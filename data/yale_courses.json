Space capabilities enable unprecedented economic opportunities across multiple fields of endeavor, ranging from environment and agriculture to transportation, science, and banking.  At the same time, space has become essential to national defense: it underpins the ability of advanced militaries to navigate and track forces, to maintain robust communications, to detect missile launches, and to ensure effective command and control.  Yet the evolution in uses of space, and advances in space technology, create novel risks, vulnerabilities, and threats. This course aims to equip students with an understanding of the dynamic, rapidly evolving domain of outer space.  After analyzing some of the unique technical and legal features of the space domain, the class explores the strategic significance of space to American national security interests, particularly as space becomes more competitive among nations. The course also focuses on the rise of the commercial space industry, the growing number of space activities undertaken by corporations, and the role of public-private partnerships in ensuring the resilience of national space assets and the global space economy. In collaboration with the U.S. Air Force Academy, students also participate in an intensive space conflict tabletop exercise, assuming the roles of key stakeholders in an engaging simulation.

In effect, the course uses this aspect as a metonym for the racial, gender, sexual, and class heterogeneity of queer art and organizing. It conducts its investigation by looking at a variety of primary materials that illustrate the heterogeneous makeup of queer and trans politics.

However, these foreigner-authored fantasies have often overshadowed the lived experience and life storytelling of Caribbean subjects. This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the “tropics” has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class begins with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique’s roots in black feminisms.

The racialized slavery that emerged in the Americas was new to World History, developed by European colonists to exploit the natural resources of the Americas. Initially, European colonists enslaved indigenous peoples wherever possible, yet by the late sixteenth century the enslavement of Africans had become far more common. We focus upon North American and the Caribbean, where European colonists developed sophisticated agricultural enterprises that produced for export to the European market and were completely dependent upon the enslaved labor of Africans. An enormous ocean commerce trafficked almost twelve million enslaved captives from the Atlantic coasts of Africa to work on the plantations of the Americas. The commerce in tobacco, sugar, rum, and cotton enabled these colonies to develop. Black people resisted enslavement at multiple levels, and throughout the Americas there emerged the Black cultures, languages, musics, struggles, and histories that we know and love today.

The US carceral state is sweeping, with nearly 2 million people currently incarcerated on any given day and a targeted policing apparatus that brings people under the penal net. At the same time, countries in Latin America have high rates of incarceration and often even higher rates of police violence than the US. These dynamics are deeply racialized and shape individuals, families, and communities. But that is not the full story.

But even here the winds of change could not be stopped. But what did decolonization and independence mean to Africa? Did Africans get what they wanted? Was independence a cup of plenty or a poisoned chalice? In addressing these questions, this course charts the economic, political, and cultural transformations of postcolonial Africa from the 1960s to the present.

The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people.

We ask how racial regimes and spaces have been constructed in French colonial discourses and how these constructions have evolved in postcolonial France. We examine postcolonial African diasporic literary writings, films, and other cultural productions that have explored the complex relations between race, colonialism, historical silences, republican universalism, and color-blindness. Topics include the 1931 Colonial Exposition, Black Paris, decolonization, universalism, the Trente Glorieuses, the Paris massacre of 1961, anti-racist movements, the \"beur\" author, memory, the 2005 riots, and contemporary afro-feminist and decolonial movements.

It is a Semitic language, similar to Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew, written on clay tablets in the Cuneiform script. Hundreds of thousands of documents in Akkadian have come down to us. They include everything from great works of literature like the Gilgamesh Epic, to everyday texts such as letters that document the lives of people from all walks of life, from great kings to commoners and slaves. Whether it be a letter to a paranoid emperor who refuses to eat and shuts himself in his own palace, or a particularly inept spy reporting to his superiors about the suspicious dreams of a suspected enemy of the state, knowledge of Akkadian opens a window into the world of those who lived thousands of years ago, the struggles they faced and the stories they told. Akkadian for Beginners provides students with the tools to begin to explore that ancient and once-forgotten world of ancient Mesopotamia.

We ask how do Latinx creative expressions expand the notions of citizenship, nation, and family beyond their raced, classed, and gendered origins to imagine new futures. Through attention to contemporary tv, film, novels, and poetry, we examine how Latinx artists build alternative forms of thriving collective life in forms of mutual aid, queer kinship, party, and protest.

Agee’s range as a writer—as an award-winning poet and fiction writer and a celebrated film critic as well—strongly reinforces that lesson.

    "Course Descrpition": "This introductory lecture offers students a scholarly initiation into the field of early American studies while also reflecting on the increasingly loud politicization of “early American history” as a scholarly and rhetorical project. From Hannah Nikole Jones’ 1619 Project to the first Trump administration’s 1776 Commission, from the “originalism” or some members of the United States judiciary to the neo-monarchism of so-called “dark enlightenment” thinkers (the Enlightenment itself also being an eighteenth-century movement, if a relatively small one), the politics of our present moment regularly invoke early American history to ground and legitimate their ethical, political, historical, and visionary claims. While this course is primarily an introduction to early American studies—an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the period that draws on scholarship in history, literature, and law, among other fields— the course is organized into three sections, organized around three themes (sovereignty, labor, and governance), and at the end of each section we engage twenty-first century political debates surrounding these themes. This course focuses on British colonial North America, and then the early national United States before 1865, but readings cluster around the long eighteenth century. Topics may include the histories, geographies and politics of Native nations prior to the incursion of Europeans into the region; the labor cultures of bondage (chattel slavery) and indenture; anti-government, anti-monarchical and revolutionary movements; the legal architecture of Native dispossession; the beginnings of nationalist imperialism; the politics of democratic governance; regional, religion-based, and culturally-specific formations of gendered and sexual comportment; visual and/or literary arts of the era; abolitionist movements (temperance, anti-slavery); the creation of citizenship infrastructures as well as those controlling immigration and naturalization; and contemporary visions of what “Americanness” meant, looked like, or represented.

We examine manifestations of romantic love in medieval Arab cultures as precedents to the invention of courtly love. In the second part of our course, we turn to modern humanistic theories about romantic love. Among the questions that critical theorists and philosophers have posed, we consider: How is love related to desire? Is sexual desire an indispensable component of romantic love? Is romantic love ultimately a selfish, exclusionary act, or is it about renouncing the self, losing the self in the other? In the third part of our course, we apply the insights of parts 1 and 2 to discuss case studies of romantic love in the contemporary United States.

    "Course Descrpition": "Uwe Johnson's Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl remains a monument of postwar German literature – and it was written in and about New York City. Across its 367 short chapters (each corresponding to a day of the year), the novel unfolds on three levels: the historical present in New York, memories and family history from Germany, and reporting from the New York Times on current events. The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson's sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel are complemented by relevant short readings on theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required.

Whether writing in Haiti or its wide-ranging diasporas, Haitian authors have boldly contributed to pressing conversations in global letters while reflecting Haiti's unique cultural and historical experiences. Considering an expansive array of poets, playwrights, and novelists - such as Baron de Vastey, Juste Chanlatte, Demesvar Delorme, Edwidge Danticat, René Depestre, Kettly Mars, Dany Laferrière, and Évelyne Trouillot – this course engages students in a fresh examination of Haiti’s richly polyglot and transnational literary tradition that spans more than two centuries.

    "Course Descrpition": "Although we spend approximately one third of our lives asleep, since the industrial revolution and the emergence of uninterrupted city lighting, industrialized societies seem to have developed an ambivalent relation to sleep: both protected and devalued for the sake of higher standards of productive work. The devaluation of sleep, in particular, has produced, during the twentieth and the first two decades of the twenty-first centuries, an array of social, political, and medical discourses to study the impact of changing patterns of sleep and sleeplessness at the global level. This seminar studies topics in the politics and cultures of sleep and sleeplessness, which posit sleep as a human practice. As any human practice, it is framed by cultural and political settings, so that how, when, why, where, and who sleeps vary across sectors of society, across past and present and across world cultures. We study historical, literary, philosophical, sociological, political, and filmic texts. A cultural, social, and political understanding of sleep and sleeplessness can reveal how sleep has been transformed into a bodily site upon which social values are imposed, social surveillance is enacted, ideas about “normality” are instrumentalized, resulting in a demand that humans adapt to human-made changing conditions of production, rather than universally unchanging health needs.

Since their discovery in 1856, they have fascinated the public with their position as our closest, yet extinct, relatives. For decades Neanderthals were portrayed as nasty, brutish, and passively lacking the talent and innovation that allowed humans to survive and thrive. Recently, they have become celebrated as our close cousins or even just another group of ancient humans. But what does modern science say about Neanderthal life and extinction, and what do Neanderthals tell us about ourselves? By asking the question “were Neanderthals human,” this course examines what it actually means to be human. Students learn the archaeological, fossil, and biomolecular records of Neanderthals, early modern humans, and other contemporaneous human relatives.  They also learn the foundations of human evolutionary science, with a focus on the Middle and Late Pleistocene (770,000 to 11,500 years ago), when the genus Homo diversified into as many as seven species–including our own.

Using a comparative archaeological perspective—focusing on settlement patterns, urbanism, craft production, monumentality, and diverse material culture—we examine how both local factors and long-distance connections shaped these trajectories.

This seminar explores how these new attempts for belated imperial reckoning are reshaping relations between former empires and their ex-colonies. It approaches imperial reckoning as a site for redressing not only the original violence but also the transitional injustice incurred in the process of the unmaking of empire, which calls for post-imperial reckoning. Drawing on examples from recent cases, this course explores what it means to belatedly reckon with imperial violence today. What does it mean to reckon with imperial violence through legal means, decades after the dissolution of empires? What is the role of law in belated redress? How is historical responsibility articulated and by whom? Who is responsible for what, then and now? What are the stakes in reckoning with distant, yet still alive, pasts? Why and how does it matter today for those of us who have no direct experience of imperial violence?

Beyond questions of scarcity and sustainability, water allows human life to flourish, and without water, there would be no civilization. Yet water is not equitably distributed across time or space, leading to contestation and conflict around water. Against such a background of strife, this course examines how human beings have related to water, to other life forms, and to each other through the control of water, in different historical moments and different parts of the world. The seminar is organized around four porous thematic clusters: (i) “urban water”, to do with cities and urban industrial life; (ii) “agrarian water”, to do with rivers, irrigation systems, and agrarian life; (iii) “rural water”, to do with coasts, lakes, dams and rural life; and (iv) and “living water”, to do with social, cultural and political values, and human and more-than-human life. This seminar introduces students to the everyday values of water, as well as the everyday politics of water, including the production of water and its attendant politics at the level of the nation-state as well as the city municipality while also being attentive to the moral ecologies of water.

Key conceptual questions explored in this course include: What is nationalism and how did Central Asian nations emerge? What is Islam as an object of scholarly inquiry?

As we begin to follow the evidence for changes in subsistence in the hominin lineage, case studies using these methods are integrated into discussions of how we know what we do about past nutrition. The course spends time on key issues and debates such as changes from closed-habitat to open-habitat foraging, the origins of meat-eating, the role of extractive foraging in human social systems, variation in hunter-forager subsistence systems, the origins of domestication, and the phenomenon of fad diets in industrialized nations.

    "Course Descrpition": "Critical to colonial, imperial, and capitalist expansion, the Atlantic offers a dynamic setting for adapting ethnographic practices to address questions around interconnected oppressions, revolts, and revolutions that are foundational to global modernity. Anchored in a Spanish and a Colombian port city, this course engages trans-Atlantic 'worlding' through a multi-sited and historically grounded ethnographic lens. Las Palmas—the earliest mid-Atlantic port and Europe's first settler colony in Africa—and Cartagena—once the principal gateway connecting Spain and its American empire—illuminate urgent contemporary issues such as climate, displacement, inter-regional subjectivities, and commerce. During a spring recess field experience (March 8–16, 2026), students immerse themselves for four nights each in Las Palmas and Cartagena, developing critical \"tracking\" skills that bridge ethnographic practice with cultural theory. Preparation for fieldwork includes an on-campus curriculum, organized around Cartagena and Las Palmas, and sessions with Yale Ethnography Hub faculty, covering different methodologies. As part of this broader programming, the curriculum delves into trans-Atlantic migrations from the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa that have transformed port cities, labor and aesthetic practices, class-making racial formations, and global geopolitics. After recess, the course shifts toward independent work, as students synthesize field-collected data and insights into a collaborative multimodal group project and individual ethnographic papers.  Interested students must apply by November 1st via the course website.

How societies remember difficult pasts has become a contested site for negotiating the present. Through the lens of memory, we examine complex roles that our relationships to difficult pasts play in navigating issues we face today. This course explores this politics of memory that takes place in the realm of popular culture and public space. The class asks such questions as: How do you represent difficult and contested pasts? What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation? Through examples drawn from the Holocaust, the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, the Vietnam War, genocide in Indonesia and massacres in Lebanon, to debates on confederacy statues, slavery, and lynching in the US, this course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as memory, trauma, mourning, silence, voice, testimony, and victimhood.

We examine how they are both shaped by and shape experiences of nationality, migration, and statelessness. Highlighting how gender and sexual minorities, and the gendered regulation of life, more broadly, both animate and contest colonial legacies tied to a racialized notion of “modernity.” Through ethnography, history, and literature, students confront a political economy of intimacies that continuously reshape what it means to be or not to be a citizen. Our approach extends beyond borders and laws to include the everyday acts of citizenship that rework race, religion, and ethnicity across transnational fronts. We discuss how people navigate their lives in the everyday, from the ordinary poetry of identity and belonging to the spectacular drama of war and conflict. Our goal is to challenge orientalist legacies that dismiss theoretical insights from scholarship on and from this region by labeling it as focused on exceptional cases instead of addressing “universal” issues. Instead, we take seriously that the specific historical and social contexts of the Middle East and North Africa reveal how connections based on gender and sexuality within and across families and social classes are deeply entwined with racial narratives of state authority and political sovereignty on a global scale.

This class is organized according to various themes within a diachronical approach, from the 4th millennium BC to the Roman Period. Copper and precious metals, construction stones, hard stones and gems, glass and faience production, imported wood or ivory, we explore multiple categories of materials, where and how they were collected or exchanged, the way these products were transported, transformed, refined or assembled and the complex organization of the work involved and administration that was required in order to satisfy the tastes of Egyptian elites or their desires to worship their gods. Some other vernacular savoir-faire linked to the everyday life and the death is explored, through food production and mummification practices. The aim of this seminar is not only to give an overview of the history of techniques for this early civilization but, beyond how things were made, to acquire a more critical view of ancient Egyptian culture through the material culture and as well the strong economic and sociologic implications linked to their objects and constructions – rather than the usual focus on its temples and tombs.

Since their discovery in 1856, they have fascinated the public with their position as our closest, yet extinct, relatives. For decades Neanderthals were portrayed as nasty, brutish, and passively lacking the talent and innovation that allowed humans to survive and thrive. Recently, they have become celebrated as our close cousins or even just another group of ancient humans. But what does modern science say about Neanderthal life and extinction, and what do Neanderthals tell us about ourselves? By asking the question “were Neanderthals human,” this course examines what it actually means to be human. Students learn the archaeological, fossil, and biomolecular records of Neanderthals, early modern humans, and other contemporaneous human relatives.  They also learn the foundations of human evolutionary science, with a focus on the Middle and Late Pleistocene (770,000 to 11,500 years ago), when the genus Homo diversified into as many as seven species–including our own.

In this seminar, we explore archaeological evidence for the development of social and political organization and religious practices, using selected examples from East and Southeast Asia spanning approximately 5000 BCE to 1500 CE. We examine four key themes: (1) the origins and timing of plant and animal domestication, (2) the emergence and impact of early metallurgy, (3) patterns of interregional interaction, and (4) the rise of sociopolitical complexity. Using a comparative archaeological perspective—focusing on settlement patterns, urbanism, craft production, monumentality, and diverse material culture—we examine how both local factors and long-distance connections shaped these trajectories.

    "Course Descrpition": "This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of urban design within the context of the broader fields of urbanism and urban history. That is to say that the design of the built environment will be considered in relation to patterns and practices of urban life and culture, and as a response to historical transformations of the political, economic and technological forces that have shaped cities since antiquity, but especially since the industrial revolution. The course will attempt to negotiate between the broader landscape suggested by these forces and the specifics of particular cities at critical moments in their development and the projects which represent the efforts of those cities and their designers to come to terms with the dynamics of urban change. Thus the lectures will include monographic treatments of specific cities and exemplary urban design projects, as well as the general issues and principles of city design suggested by those case studies, including consideration of their implications for contemporary practice. The weekly classes will provide opportunities for the introduction of supplementary examples from the wider field of international urbanism, as well as introducing techniques of urban representation and analysis relevant to the assignments and to student work in studios. Classes will also provide time for discussion of readings and lectures and issues of current interest. HU 0 Course cr W 9am-10:30am"

    "Course Descrpition": "Cities have always been hotbeds of radical ideas and actions. Their cafes and taverns, drawing rooms and universities have been incubators of new ideas, revolutionary ideologies and debate, while their streets and public spaces have been the sites of demonstrations, protests, and uprisings. Since cities are key nodes in larger networks of trade and cultural exchange, these local events have often had a global audience and impact. This seminar explores the interaction of urban space and event, and the media and technologies of revolutionary representation, through case studies of particular cities at transformational moments in their development. These begin with Boston in the 1760s and 1770s, and may include Paris in 1789, 1830, 1848, 1871 and again in 1968, St. Petersburg in 1917, Beijing in 1949 and again in 1989, Havana in 1959, Prague, Berlin and Johannesburg and other cities in 1989, Cairo in 2011, Hong Kong in 2011-12, 2014 and 2019, and other urban sites of the Occupy and Black Lives Matter movements. Course work in modern history is recommended.

Through exploring the history of newness as an idea, its current understanding within philosophy, and examining its understanding in multiple creative fields today including art, architecture, product design, social microcultures, cars, food, fashion, and toys, students gain both knowledge about the role of “The New” in human society and are exposed to cutting-edge ideas in multiple disciplines. Through the study of emerging creative trends, detailed historic case studies, both philosophical and popular readings, and engaged group discussion we examine the very concept of “The New” from all possible angles—what it is, its history, why it is desired, the motivations of those that produce and promote it, who profits from it, and the morality of its continued rehearsal in a world with evolving ethics regarding the use of human labor and natural resources in the production of things. This course encourages students to consider these positions through not only research, presentations and discussion, but also speculative ‘making’ that challenges students to address the subject of “The New” themselves—through the very process of design.

Working across media from policy to poetry, film to form, memoir to historiography, fiction to finance, Groundlessness troubles and complicates the grounds and grounding(s) of urban and environmental imaginaries. Attending to cultural, aesthetic, technological, legal, economic, and environmental conditions, this course asks how these factors shape the work of the racial as visually and spatially performed (and in part, contribute to disdain for housing the black and poor in tall towers; the difficulty with imagining folks racialized as black holding a position up in the sky). Groundlessness explores the many ways the work of constructing the built environment occurs well before and beyond the involvement of any architect; and ultimately seeks out the promise and freedoms of leaving the land behind (and below), living untethered from the land, on invented lands, unstable ground, off the ground, and up high.

Muralists take risks when they commit to an art practice that is outside the museum or gallery. They must negotiate both multiple, unpredictable publics, their own privacy, and the socio-political ‘publicness’ of their work. Community-engaged artmaking provokes, mobilizes, and forever alters the spaces and audiences it encounters. Course topics include Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel, Mexican muralists and revolution, civic mural movements in the U.S., graffiti as a global phenomenon, and murals in the region, such as New Haven and New York City. This course includes art history through practice, creating a more integrated way of learning the history of mural making, from prehistory to the present, by collectively painting a mural in the Peabody Museum. Working with a local muralist, students learn how to navigate the process of creating a mural, from the proposal to the budget to the community programming and the execution.

This course provides students a theoretical base in child development and behavior and tools to sensitively and carefully observer infants and young children. The seminar will consider aspects of cognitive, social, and emotional development. An assumption of this course is that it is not possible to understand children – their behavior and development—without understanding their families and culture and the relationships between children and parents. The course will give an overview of the major theories in the field, focusing on the complex interaction between the developing self and the environment, exploring current research and theory as well as practice. Students will have the opportunity to see how programs for young children use psychodynamic and interactional theories to inform the development of their philosophy and curriculum. Weekly Observations:-Total Time Commitment 3 hours per week. Students will do two separate weekly observations over the course of the semester. They will observe in a group setting for 2 hours each each week at a Yale affiliated child care center.  Students will also arrange to do a weekly 1 hour observation (either in person or virtually) of a child under the age of 6.

Goals are to deepen insights through critical analysis of educational programs for young children in light of current research and developmental theory and to understand how culture and political context contribute to the practice of education. Regularly scheduled seminar discussions and workshops that engage students with learning materials emphasize the ongoing dynamic process of developing emergent curriculum and focus on methods of creating a responsive, inclusive environment; planning and assessment; appreciating cultural and linguistic diversity; teachers’ roles; anti-bias education; working with families; conceptualizing the professional challenges of collaborating on a teaching team within the organization of the school; standards and accountability and the role of policy and advocacy in educational change.

Research indicates that play enhances a child’s creativity, intellectual development and social emotional development. Because learning to play, learning language and learning literacy skills are all part of the process of thinking and communication , the course will provide a view which attempts to demonstrate the integration of language, literacy and play in an early childhood education curriculum.

This course covers the foundations of lattice-based cryptography from fundamental definitions to advanced cryptographic constructions. More precisely, we introduce the Learning with Error (LWE) and the Short Integer Solutions (SIS) problems and study their unique properties, such as the fact that their average-case hardness is based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems. Next, we cover lattice constructions of advanced cryptographic primitives, such as fully homomorphic encryption and signature schemes. Finally, we introduce some notions of quantum cryptography and explore the role of lattices in this area. Overall, this course offers insights into the foundations and recent advancements in lattice-based cryptography.  Prerequisite: CPSC 467/567 or equivalent and linear algebra MW 4pm-5:15pm"

    "Course Descrpition": "You type your question into ChatGPT and get back a response – how do you trust its accuracy? Perhaps you have reviewed the latest published benchmark results for GPT-4, or trust that others have. But how do you know the response you are getting from OpenAI’s servers is the true output of GPT-4? Perhaps due to a bug or system overload your question was handled by a weaker AI model. Or worse, perhaps the servers were hacked by someone maliciously giving you incorrect results. And, how do you trust that the sensitive questions you are sending to ChatGPT will not be leaked or used against you? This is a course in cryptographic proof systems. In the digital world today, we trust services to perform many kinds of computations on our data, from managing financial ledgers and databases to complex analytics, such as large-language model (LLM) inference. We trust these services not only to operate correctly, but also to keep our information private. Cryptographic systems allow us to remove this trust. A “succinct” cryptographic proof enables a service to attach a small certificate on the correctness of its computation which can be verified easily on a low-power device, even if the original computation was extremely complex. The proof of some ML computation that was run for hours on a GPU farm can fit in an email and take just milliseconds to verify on a mobile device! Beyond correctness, a “zero-knowledge” proof system enables us to prove knowledge of secret information, including hidden inputs to a computation that achieves a certain output. For instance, OpenAI could prove that the response is the true output of GPT-4 (a proprietary model) without revealing sensitive details about the model itself. In industry, the market for cryptographic proofs is currently around $75 million and projected to reach $10 billion by 2030, according to some estimates. Cryptographic proofs have become the leading technology for scaling blockchains and achieving privacy in cryptocurrencies. Verifiable and zero-knowledge computing also create an important foundation for decentralizing AI services. Training and serving large models currently require vast resources, leading to centralization. Decentralized ML networks offer a compelling alternative—letting many independent operators contribute incremental work to the overall task using their own resources big or small, from a single GPU to a server cluster, and earn a share of the payments clients make to use the service. In such a setting it is critical to verify that operators contribute incremental work correctly. Or, they may use private data to jointly train an ML model. Succinct zero-knowledge proofs would enable these operators to prove correctness of their work without revealing sensitive data. We will cover some of the other challenges and directions in decentralized model training and inference, such as reducing the amount of data that needs to be communicated between physically distributed islands of hardware and the potential role of reinforcement learning.

Our reading is guided by a different “ism” each week, from 19th-century eroticism and exoticism, through mid-century cosmopolitanism and colonialism, to second-wave feminism and existentialism in the wake of World War II. These distinct moments in the development of Japanese modernism (modanizumu) are shaped by encounters with foreign cultures, and by the importing of foreign ideas and vogues. All the same, we question—along with modernist writer Yū Ryūtanji – the “critique that says modanizumu is nothing more than the latest display of imported cosmetics” (1930). We seek to develop a correspondingly nuanced picture of the specific and changing ways in which Japan understood and figured its relationship to the rest of the world through the course of a century.

What does it mean to enable long-silenced victims’ voices to be heard? What are the consequences of re-narrating the past by highlighting past injuries and trauma? Does memory work heal or open wounds of a society and a nation?

It addresses a set of themes whose point of entry is the entangled character of visual production and reception in Japan at a tipping point in the emergence of global modernity, when what were called the Nanbans—“Southern Barbarians,” i.e. Europeans—began to arrive in Japan. The question of whether or not much-theorized nomenclatures such as baroque , rococo , mestizo , and even global modernity are pertinent to analysis from the Japanese and Asian perspective constitutes the backbone of the course and its primary objective in the study of a corpus of visual materials spanning the European and Asian cultural spheres. As such the seminar is not only about Japan, per se, or about Japanese objects, or the shogunal eye. It is equally about how Japan and Japanese objects and materials, along with objects and materials from other places, figured in a greater community of exchange, friction, confrontation, conquest, and adaptation in times when Portuguese marauders, Jesuit missionaries, Muslim traders, and Japanese pirates found themselves in the same waters, on ships laden with goods, making landfall in the domains of Japan’s great military hegemons.

The second is to examine the main theoretical frameworks scholars have employed to better understand these historical transformations. Key conceptual questions explored in this course include: What is nationalism and how did Central Asian nations emerge? What is Islam as an object of scholarly inquiry? What is secularism, and how does it shape and regulate religion? How did Soviet and Chinese secularization campaigns transfigure Islam in Central Asia and Xinjiang? What forces facilitate the ongoing ethnocide of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang? HU HTBA"

The rich and varied definitions of food have also enabled humans, the animal at the top of the food chains, to create many new ones. Food enters and becomes a part of the human body; in other words, the food we consume has become ourselves. How we define food also determines the way in which we relate to other living beings. We will explore cultural practices of food chains in East Asian societies, with a focus on China, Japan, and South Korea. class will guide students to think about the origins, production, and creation of food, as well as the politics, ethics, and technologies that are intertwined with the circulation of food. By reading ethnographies of food, this class provides students with the theoretical and methodological means to observe and analyze perhaps the most common thing in life. Food is not just a static object, but part of the global food chains that are constantly circulating, and part of the circulation with the human body. SO M 3:30pm-5:20pm"

The rapid advancement of new technologies in the 21st century necessitates new laws and regulations. Therefore, in addition to traditional law and economics topics, the course explores recent developments in the regulation of new technologies and estimates the causal effect of changes in law on economic performance. The study of legal statutes and regulations provides an opportunity to apply microeconomic tools to substantive policy issues. Price theory, game theory, agency theory, and models of trade with asymmetric information are among the tools that are utilized. These tools provide a framework for understanding and predicting the consequences of legal changes. The empirical literature reviewed in the course provides estimates on the magnitude of the effects that legal changes have on economic performance and individual well-being.

We study the positive and negative consequences of this community involvement for growth and development; in the short-run and the long-run. We also provide economic foundations for the emergence of social norms and identity, as well as the dynamic inefficiencies that they can generate with economic development. (iii) Biological Response: how biological adaptation to economic conditions in the pre-modern economy can have negative consequences for nutritional status and health in developing economies.

Quasi-experiments take advantage of real-world events—such as policy changes or eligibility rules—that create treatment and comparison groups in ways that can mimic random assignment. These methods are widely used not only when experiments are infeasible, but also when researchers want to answer causal questions that experiments may not be well suited to address. We examine the strengths and limitations of commonly used methods—such as difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity—and apply them to policy-relevant topics such as the returns to education, the inner workings of labor markets, the effects of incarceration, and the evaluation of social programs. The course combines mathematical reasoning with creative thinking: students learn the formal assumptions and arguments that justify a method and study examples of how quasi-experiments are used in empirical economic research.

An assumption of this course is that it is not possible to understand children – their behavior and development—without understanding their families and culture and the relationships between children and parents. The course will give an overview of the major theories in the field, focusing on the complex interaction between the developing self and the environment, exploring current research and theory as well as practice. Students will have the opportunity to see how programs for young children use psychodynamic and interactional theories to inform the development of their philosophy and curriculum.

The book is about three white tenant farmers and their lives and families—about their subsistence yet survival during the Great Depression, the worst economic disaster in American history, which started in 1929 and ended during World War II. This seminar concentrating on Agee’s nonfiction— Praise and journalism of his—is a vehicle for learning about the range of skills and sensibilities that the most effective and affecting nonfiction writing calls on: powers of observation; the ability to recognize and tell a story; insight in portraying people, places, objects, and history; precision in word choice; a sense of music in language; and more. Agee’s range as a writer—as an award-winning poet and fiction writer and a celebrated film critic as well—strongly reinforces that lesson. A semester spent reading, thinking, talking, and writing about Agee and related subjects is an opportunity for immersion in the work of a great, now generally obscure, American writer and his world.

These are all words in the English language, but, like all words, they have different meanings, functions, and social purposes; indeed, the meaning and function may be different for the same word depending on the context in which we use it (whether spoken or written). In this course, we explore the wonderful world of words. We look at how we create new words (and why), how we change the meaning of words, and how words have been lost (and revived) over time. As we do so, we look at debates over words and their meanings now (such as the feeling by some that ain’t is not a word at all) and historically (such as the distaste for subpeditals for ‘shoes’ in the sixteenth century), and how words can be manipulated to insult, hurt, and discriminate against others. We look at a wide range of texts by well-known authors (such as Shakespeare) as well as anonymous online bloggers, and we make use of online tools like the Google Ngram viewer and the Corpus of Historical American English to see how words change over time. At the end of the course, I hope you see how we make sophisticated use of words and how studying them opens up new ways for you to understand why other people use words the way they do and how you can use words for various purposes in your own speech and writing.

From the suspension of Puerto Rican sovereignty to the contemporary proliferation of ethnic studies bans, the state has used the law to delimit Latinx to transparent or static categories of irregular “citizen,” “refugee,” and “migrant.”  If conventional thinking assumes that art only responds to the law in protest or affirmation of the status quo, this seminar introduces students to the ways Latinx literature engages, resists, and disidentifies with the law as it delineates national belonging. We ask how do Latinx creative expressions expand the notions of citizenship, nation, and family beyond their raced, classed, and gendered origins to imagine new futures. Through attention to contemporary tv, film, novels, and poetry, we examine how Latinx artists build alternative forms of thriving collective life in forms of mutual aid, queer kinship, party, and protest.

This seminar explores Canada’s long, complex history, and striking linguistic diversity by exploring its literary (and at moments, its cinematic) traditions. Like Canada itself, its literature represents a \"contact zone\" between First Nations peoples, French and British settlers, and immigrants from Eastern Europe, East and South Asia, and the Caribbean. We focus particularly on Canada’s diverse early literatures (from oral tradition and Jesuit hymn to a sentimental novel-in-letters); on the unusually prominent role of women writers across Canadian literary history; on the emergence of an experimental Québecois and francophone literature (which utilized both Montreal patois and Acadian French as new literary languages); on the differences between French and English Canadian cultural nationalism; on attempts to rethink colonial history and critiques of Canada’s ongoing decolonization process by generations of Indigenous, immigrant and ethnic writers. This course explores both literary history and literary form; works by internationally famous writers (Leonard Cohen, Marie-Claire Blais, Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro, Michael Ondaatje, Rohinton Mistry) and innovative local counterparts.

This evolving ‘Nigerian visual novel’, or ‘video novel’, is defined by its loosely structured, tabloid-themed and reader-friendly style, all reflecting the craft of Nollywood films, a thriving video film culture that emerged in the 1990s and has remained popular globally. Through the study of Nollywood films alongside new Nigerian fiction, the course will examine the techniques adopted by writers to accommodate the aesthetics of popular culture, to revive a declining readership, and to make literature more sellable. As these novels win literature prizes and find their way onto syllabi, the implications they have for our understanding of the African literary canon will be discussed. Students will view selected Nollywood movies and read a number of novels in the new genre in order to appraise the extent to which the serious and the sensuous intersect in this remaking of literariness. Seminar discussions will be accompanied by short lectures in which concepts such as ‘trans-mediality’, ‘reverse-adaptation’, ‘screen-to-page’, ‘appropriation’ and ‘quotation’ will be discussed to build an understanding of how the ‘new’ approach reconfigures Nigerian novels.

How does that history influence our collective lives in the present, and what are some alternatives? This course gives students a background in the development of sex science, from evolutionary arguments that racialized sexual dimorphism to the contemporary technologies that claim to be able to get at bodily truths that are supposedly more real than identity. It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer.

Class topics include collecting, cleaning, and managing data, exploring and analyzing data, choosing and using chart types, formatting charts, human perception and biases, principles of design, and visual communication. We work with various software for managing data and creating charts, including data cleaning (OpenRefine), spreadsheets and charts (Excel, Sheets), presentation (Powerpoint, Slides), statistics and charts (base R, ggplot), charts (DataWrapper, Tableau), GIS (ArcGIS), and other tools to develop visualizations using diverse datasets.  A basic understanding of descriptive statistics is expected.

Imagine the ocean spiking a fever: cold-blooded organisms of all shapes, sizes and complexities struggle to survive when water temperatures go up 2-4 degrees.

Predicted and observed changes in temperature, pH and salt concentration do and will affect many parameters of the living world, from the kinetics of chemical reactions and cellular signaling pathways to the accumulation of unforeseen chemicals in the environment, the appearance and dispersal of new diseases, and the development of new foods. In this course, we approach climate change from the molecular point of view, identifying how cells and organisms – from microbes to plants and animals – respond to changing environmental conditions. To embrace the concept of “one health” for all life on the planet, this course leverages biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biophysics, and genetics to develop an understanding of the impact of climate change on the living world.

In this course, we examine the need, scale, and timelines for carbon containment as expressed by international climate commitments and corporate climate goals. Then, we examine the scientific foundations for key carbon containment pathways including emission reductions of key short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) as well as CDR in biologic, geologic and engineered systems. Finally, we investigate the challenges facing these carbon containment approaches, including siting, commercialization, measuring, and communicating the costs and benefits of these approaches to different audiences. We discuss how carbon containment pathways affect environmental justice concerns and goals in different regions of the US and internationally. Over the course of the semester, students do an investigation of one carbon containment approach, culminating in a report describing key components of the science, economics, social license, and regulatory landscape, and ultimately, a pathway to scale.

We start by exploring the fundamental theories in morality (e.g., Consequentialism, Deontology, and Rights Theory) and well-being (e.g., Hedonism, Desire-satisfaction, and Objective List views). We then use these theories to critically analyze particular moral and social controversies. In particular, we explore how these theories answer the following questions, “Is abortion morally permissible?”, “Is euthanasia morally wrong?”, “Should there be limits on free speech? If so, when?”, “Should there be limits on what can be bought and sold?”, “Can the state be justified in interfering with who gets to parent children?”, “How open should state borders be?”, “What do we owe the global poor?” SO Th 9:25am-11:15am"

Interpersonal relationships are a central part of our lives. As social creatures, they are essential for our well-being and the meaningfulness of our lives. But they raise important moral questions. For example, do we have special obligations to our friends, family, or co-national? Are we epistemically permitted to ignore evidence if it indicates that our friend or family has done something wrong? Is there a conflict between what morality requires and what is required for being a good friend or family member? What’s wrong or bad about being friends with an immoral person?

This seminar explores how these new attempts for belated imperial reckoning are reshaping relations between former empires and their ex-colonies. It approaches imperial reckoning as a site for redressing not only the original violence but also the transitional injustice incurred in the process of the unmaking of empire, which calls for post-imperial reckoning. Drawing on examples from recent cases, this course explores what it means to belatedly reckon with imperial violence today. What does it mean to reckon with imperial violence through legal means, decades after the dissolution of empires? What is the role of law in belated redress? How is historical responsibility articulated and by whom? Who is responsible for what, then and now? What are the stakes in reckoning with distant, yet still alive, pasts? Why and how does it matter today for those of us who have no direct experience of imperial violence?

We ask how do Latinx creative expressions expand the notions of citizenship, nation, and family beyond their raced, classed, and gendered origins to imagine new futures. Through attention to contemporary tv, film, novels, and poetry, we examine how Latinx artists build alternative forms of thriving collective life in forms of mutual aid, queer kinship, party, and protest.

    "Course Descrpition": "The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization?  Prerequisite: SPAN 140 or 145, or in accordance with placement results.

This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures.

As we move geographically and temporally, we trace the ways British and American legal systems constructed Indigenous women as subjects of empire, shaping their legal status, kinship structures, and sovereignty. A central theme of the course is Indigenous women's resistance to settler legal impositions. Through case studies—including early colonial legal battles, the forced removals of women and children, and contemporary struggles for justice and land rights—we examine how Indigenous women have asserted legal and extralegal agency in the face of colonial authority.

The course pays particular attention to how colonialism has mobilized forces such as religion and science to cement and justify racial hierarchies, often placing Blackness at the bottom. We also explore the variegated forms of anti-Blackness and their contestations in the United States and beyond. We then turn to how contemporary transnational migrations have generated racial frictions and new understandings of who counts as Black.

Las Palmas—the earliest mid-Atlantic port and Europe's first settler colony in Africa—and Cartagena—once the principal gateway connecting Spain and its American empire—illuminate urgent contemporary issues such as climate, displacement, inter-regional subjectivities, and commerce. During a spring recess field experience (March 8–16, 2026), students immerse themselves for four nights each in Las Palmas and Cartagena, developing critical \"tracking\" skills that bridge ethnographic practice with cultural theory.

This seminar explores such imaginations of the artificially human, with an emphasis on their role within German culture, in order to examine the often-hazy boundary between artificial production and organic reproduction. We will discuss the significance of this boundary for our understanding of topics such as literature, art, labor, gender, and psychology. Readings are drawn from sources both ancient and modern, from discourses including religion, philosophy, alchemy, literature, and psychoanalysis.

This course provides a critical overview of digital war, understood as the relationship between war and digital technologies. Modern warfare has been shaped by digital technologies, but the latter have also been conditioned through modern conflict: DARPA (the research arm of the US Department of Defense), for instance, has innovated aspects of everything from GPS, to stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet. Shifting beyond a sole focus on technology and its makers, this class situates the historical antecedents and present of digital war within colonialism and imperialism. We will investigate the entanglements between technology, empire, and war, and examine how digital war—also sometimes understood as virtual or remote war—has both shaped the lives of the targeted and been conditioned by imperial ventures. We will consider visual media, fiction, art, and other works alongside scholarly texts to develop a multidiscpinary perspective on the past, present, and future of digital war. none HU , SO Th 1:30pm-3:20pm"

    "Course Descrpition": "Landscape and the natural environment have never occupied “background” status in Italian film. Given the spectacular visual presence of its terrain—thanks to the relative proximity of mountain chains and the long seacoast—and given the pivotal importance of farming and pasturage in this traditionally agrarian economy, the synergy between the human and natural worlds has played a prominent role in Italian filmmaking since the very inception of the industry. Most recently, two developments have pushed this issue to the forefront of scholarly attention: the advent of ecocriticism, which found one of its earliest and most influential champions in Serenella Iovino, and the establishment of regional film commissions, grassroots production centers that sponsored cinematic works attuned to the specificity of “the local.” The course includes study of films that predate our current environmental consciousness, as well as recent films that foreground it in narrative terms. In the case of the older films, which have already attracted a great deal of critical commentary over time, we work to shift our interpretive frame in an “eco-friendly” direction (even when the films’ characters are hardly friends of the environment). Among the films considered are Le quattro volte, Il vento fa il suo giro, L’uomo che verrà, Gomorra, L’albero degli zoccoli, Riso amaro, Red Desert , Christ Stopped at Eboli, and Il ladro di bambini .

This evolving ‘Nigerian visual novel’, or ‘video novel’, is defined by its loosely structured, tabloid-themed and reader-friendly style, all reflecting the craft of Nollywood films, a thriving video film culture that emerged in the 1990s and has remained popular globally. Through the study of Nollywood films alongside new Nigerian fiction, the course will examine the techniques adopted by writers to accommodate the aesthetics of popular culture, to revive a declining readership, and to make literature more sellable. As these novels win literature prizes and find their way onto syllabi, the implications they have for our understanding of the African literary canon will be discussed. Students will view selected Nollywood movies and read a number of novels in the new genre in order to appraise the extent to which the serious and the sensuous intersect in this remaking of literariness. Seminar discussions will be accompanied by short lectures in which concepts such as ‘trans-mediality’, ‘reverse-adaptation’, ‘screen-to-page’, ‘appropriation’ and ‘quotation’ will be discussed to build an understanding of how the ‘new’ approach reconfigures Nigerian novels.

    "Course Descrpition": "Uwe Johnson's Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl remains a monument of postwar German literature – and it was written in and about New York City. Across its 367 short chapters (each corresponding to a day of the year), the novel unfolds on three levels: the historical present in New York, memories and family history from Germany, and reporting from the New York Times on current events. The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson's sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel are complemented by relevant short readings on theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required.

Beyond considering the role of major jazzmen and jazzwomen in films such as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Charles Mingus, Benny Goodman, Thelonious Monks, Lena Horne, etc., we also analyze how jazz and African Americans are represented in Hollywood films featuring this music as a focal point or as musical accompaniment. Jazz music has served historically as a medium for early African-American presence in Hollywood films, via musical numbers and performances (Duke Ellington orchestra, the Nicholas Brothers, etc.), all while conforming to the demands of major film companies. During WWII, wartime films saw in jazz the opportunity to convey consent and support for the war ( Birth of the Blues, Blues in the Night, Syncopation ). By exploring films from the 1930s to the 1970s, and cross-examining essays by Paul Gilroy, Krin Gabbard, and others, this course calls into question these attempts and investigates the early silencing, instrumentalization, and reappropriation processes commonly characteristics of Hollywood. We contextualize this filmography by comparing it with films made by African-American film directors and analyzing their use of jazz music. The course illustrates how jazz music embodies a formal and political counter-power, evident through its themes and compositions, and demonstrates how films such as The Cry of Jazz , or The Connection capture this spirit.

Whether writing in Haiti or its wide-ranging diasporas, Haitian authors have boldly contributed to pressing conversations in global letters while reflecting Haiti's unique cultural and historical experiences.

We study the different ways of awarding book prizes and curating lists of literature. Additionally, we study the circumstances that lead to literary “hypes,” including Netflix adaptations, BookTok, and the author-as-celebrity. We read novels and excerpts of novels by some of the New York Times’ top-ranked authors, as well as by Nobel Prize laureates of recent years, and compare the different modes of selection and the benefits as well as biases inherent to the respective lists. We also look at currently circulating lists of “banned books” and the works of literature banned from official reading lists and syllabi to understand another aspect of the politics behind the curation of lists. We close our literary journey with a text by author Toni Morrison who, curiously, made all three lists.

It is strange that this framing has been taken for granted, given that all three of them took a critical stance against philosophy, aligning themselves instead with disciplines that they attempted to revolutionize or invent – political economy, philology, and psychoanalysis. This course takes up Ricoeur’s configuration just as these authors ask us to: with suspicion. We will, on the one hand, ask what the three have in common, how they teach us to doubt even the foundations of our own doubt and to construct systems that remain fundamentally open to revision. On the other hand, we will also examine the differences among the three: their contrasting histories, methods, and purposes. Finally, we will ask how these texts and authors come to us, how our own assumptions shape our engagement with them, and how we might learn from them today.

    "Course Descrpition": "The Frankfurt School of Critical Theory was (is) a group of eclectic interdisciplinary Marxist philosophers and social scientists, active from the 1920s to the present. Most were German Jews born around the turn of the 20th century. The Frankfurt school were a group of thinkers in almost perpetual exile. Simultaneously critical of American capitalism and of Soviet Communism, they were expelled from their native Germany in the wake of Hitler’s rise to power. They also often lacked any intellectual safe haven, finding themselves at odds much philosophical and social-scientific orthodoxy (positivism, neo-Kantianism, “value-free” social science etc.). The critical theorists of the Frankfurt School sought to re-actualize ideas from the philosophical tradition, especially from Kant and Hegel, in order to address the complex realities of modern society: mass culture; fascism, totalitarianism and authoritarianism; world war; imperialism; secularization; irrationality, sexuality and aggression; and so on.

In a world governed by norms and standards (against the appearance of laxness and relativism), \"badness\" and amateurism are inevitable. \"Bad\" works can be extremely popular and influential (e.g., in the cases of pseudoscience, misinformation, racism, antisemitism). The \"bad\" archive contributes to a reevaluation of critical standards, forms of official and unofficial censorship, freedom of speech and the function of taboos. The course explores famous works that have been considered aesthetically, morally, ideologically and politically pernicious (stopping short, however, of screeds and manifestos like Hitler's Mein Kampf ).

This course delves into the concept of language crises and its long history from a philosophical and literary perspective, examining how crises of language are represented in literature and how they reflect broader philosophical questions about language, identity, and power. We explore different philosophical approaches to language, such as the history of language and philology (Herder, Humboldt, Nietzsche), structuralism and post-structuralism (Saussure), analytical and pragmatic philosophies (Wittgenstein), phenomenology and deconstruction (Heidegger), and analyze how these theories shape our understanding of language while simultaneously evoking its crisis. The course also examines how such language crises are represented and produced in literature and the arts; how authors and artists approach the complexities of language loss, and how crises help birth alternative systems of signification. Through close readings of literary texts by Hofmannsthal, Musil, Bachmann, et. al., we analyze the symbolic and metaphorical significance of language crises, as well as the ethical and political implications of language loss for (cultural) identity. Experimental use of language such as DaDa artwork, performance cultures, and “Sprachspiel” poetry by the “Wiener Gruppe,” as well as contemporary KI/AI literature, further complement the theoretical readings. By exploring language crises through the lens of philosophy and literature, we gain a deeper understanding of the role of language—and its many crises—in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our communities.

    "Course Descrpition": "Uwe Johnson's Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl remains a monument of postwar German literature – and it was written in and about New York City. Across its 367 short chapters (each corresponding to a day of the year), the novel unfolds on three levels: the historical present in New York, memories and family history from Germany, and reporting from the New York Times on current events. The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson's sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel are complemented by relevant short readings on theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required.

They could have been among the first to swear allegiance to one (or several) of 130 new states, almost twice the number that existed in 1900. They would have been certain to witness massive ecological destruction, as well as unparalleled advances in medicine, science, and the arts. The twentieth century was, as one historian puts it, an age of extremes, and in this class we explore some of these aspects of the age. The class is not intended to be a complete history nor is it one that provides an integrative interpretation of historical events.

Space capabilities enable unprecedented economic opportunities across multiple fields of endeavor, ranging from environment and agriculture to transportation, science, and banking.  At the same time, space has become essential to national defense: it underpins the ability of advanced militaries to navigate and track forces, to maintain robust communications, to detect missile launches, and to ensure effective command and control.  Yet the evolution in uses of space, and advances in space technology, create novel risks, vulnerabilities, and threats. This course aims to equip students with an understanding of the dynamic, rapidly evolving domain of outer space.  After analyzing some of the unique technical and legal features of the space domain, the class explores the strategic significance of space to American national security interests, particularly as space becomes more competitive among nations. The course also focuses on the rise of the commercial space industry, the growing number of space activities undertaken by corporations, and the role of public-private partnerships in ensuring the resilience of national space assets and the global space economy. In collaboration with the U.S. Air Force Academy, students also participate in an intensive space conflict tabletop exercise, assuming the roles of key stakeholders in an engaging simulation.

Building a durable peace requires a sensitivity to the changing priorities of the signatories and international community, as well as the constituencies for whom the peace was achieved. Anchored in (but not limited to) the ongoing UN-supported peace agreement implementation process in Mali and the monitoring process of the Final Agreement to End Armed Conflict and Build a Stable and Lasting Peace in Colombia, the seminar considers peace-building processes from the perspectives of formerly warring parties, diplomats, NGOs, and civil society, providing students an opportunity to begin to catalogue strategies for building durable peace following conflict.

Agee’s range as a writer—as an award-winning poet and fiction writer and a celebrated film critic as well—strongly reinforces that lesson.

Asceticism (Greek askēsis, Arabic zuhd) acted as a path to try to achieve a surpassing degree of holiness and was often practiced in combination with mystic practices by which ascetics sought to contemplate God to become nearer to—or perhaps even one with—the divine. This course examines the long history of asceticism in the medieval Middle East, focusing on dominant ascetic trends within Christianity and Islam, namely monasticism and Sufism, respectively. It considers the context in which both developed, the long-lasting influence of each upon the other, and the role played by ascetic practitioners in other religious groups, such as pagans, Manichaeans, and most of all, Jews. We see throughout the course that even within each religious tradition, a diverse array of linguistic, cultural, and sectarian groups devoted themselves to different ascetic and mystic practices, and we consider what meanings these individuals attached to their actions.

In the past few years, we’ve encountered new stories about everything from new and restrictive abortion laws, to immigrant woman who were sterilized without their consent, to new technologies in male birth control, to the inequitable childcare burden that falls to women during times of hardship, to the racist roots of foster care and residential school systems. In this course, we come to understand the historical changes in American reproduction to better understand the complicated roots of our current moment. By analyzing articles in newspapers and scientific journals, advertisements, film, patient and physician narratives, and exhibitions and material culture, students will understand reproduction as a site for empowerment and activism, as a site of medical professionalization, and as a site of health disparity. We examine reproduction capaciously, including pregnancy and childbirth, birth control and abortion, assistive reproductive technologies, and adoption and foster care. Our analysis is intersectional, and we consider what different identities meant for reproduction historically, as well as in our current moment. HU 0 Course cr HTBA"

The many topics encountered along the way include the public and private investment in the built environment; history of housing in America; transportation and infrastructure; architectural practice; and the social and political nature of city building and urban change. Attention also paid to the transnational nature of American architecture—the role of colonialism, the global exchange of architectural ideas, and the international careers of some architects. We will take advantage of our local setting, New Haven, as a cross-section of American architectural and urban history and a storehouse of key examples of building types, urban landscapes, and architectural styles.

Together, we consider several questions that have been used to evaluate the “goodness” of a death, asking: Is there a right time to die? Can a good death be planned? Is there a right attitude or spiritual stance to have toward death? Where does a good death take place? What kind of care is best for dying people? What should be done with dead bodies? How does grief factor into the good death?  Over the semester, students investigate both aspirational visions of the good death as well as the realities of death in U.S. history. We analyze cultural, social, and medical factors that influenced the professionalization and medicalization of death into the 21st century. In addition, students are asked to probe their own assumptions about the good death and its corollary, the good life.

It was a medium-sized kingdom that had not even managed to control the entirety of its home island, and had a small part of Ireland as its sole overseas possession. In 1764, Great Britain had just won a decisive victory over France in the Seven Years’ War. It controlled the entirety of Britain and Ireland, possessed the second largest overseas empire in history, and was richer than any other European state. But then, in the space of the next two decades, the empire seemed to disintegrate as thirteen American colonies won their independence. This course examines how all that happened, both through the eyes of professional historians and the historical figures themselves.

While many of them got it easy, some had to fight long and bloody wars for it. By the 1960s the colonial edifice had crumbled except for the few settler colonies in southern Africa. But even here the winds of change could not be stopped. But what did decolonization and independence mean to Africa? Did Africans get what they wanted? Was independence a cup of plenty or a poisoned chalice? In addressing these questions, this course charts the economic, political, and cultural transformations of postcolonial Africa from the 1960s to the present.

We study the history of the nascent Dutch Republic coming out from under Spanish rule and trace Dutch voyages across the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean through the histories of the earliest chartered companies, the Dutch East India Company which dominated Sri Lanka and Netherlands East Indies (present-day Indonesia), and the Dutch West India Company in North America, the Caribbean and Brazil. We also look at how the Dutch became deeply involved in Atlantic slave trade and the Indian Ocean. We explore how with the demise of both companies, the Dutch government took direct control all over the world, and strove to maintain control and legacies of Dutch rule. Towards the late nineteenth century, Dutch imperialists altered their colonial strategies to grant more autonomy to subjects. We end by exploring the legacies of the Dutch Empire in the world.

We begin by examining the impact of colonialism on health systems, highlighting the introduction of Western medicine that dismantled local health systems and established healthcare infrastructures that primarily served colonial and elite interests. We then explore the rise of international health organizations, such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the League of Nations Health Organization (LNHO), and the World Health Organization (WHO), and the role of multilateral institutions in shaping global and local health policy in the postwar period. We also evaluate health missions between the Socialist bloc and the Third World and assess the successes and limitations of these alternative visions for promoting health equity. Over the course of the semester, we examine the experiences of health interventions and eradication programs from the perspective of recipient communities and gain an understanding of resistance, contestations, and adoption of these programs. Challenging dominant narratives that portray recipients of global health projects as passive, we evaluate how marginalized communities have variously resisted, appropriated, and shaped global technologies and ideas. Importantly, rather than following a linear North (donor) -to-South (recipient) model, we examine how the contemporary global health landscape emerged as the result of the exchange of ideas, technologies, and local knowledge and expertise between the Global North and South HU 0 Course cr HTBA"

    "Course Descrpition": "This introductory lecture offers students a scholarly initiation into the field of early American studies while also reflecting on the increasingly loud politicization of “early American history” as a scholarly and rhetorical project. From Hannah Nikole Jones’ 1619 Project to the first Trump administration’s 1776 Commission, from the “originalism” or some members of the United States judiciary to the neo-monarchism of so-called “dark enlightenment” thinkers (the Enlightenment itself also being an eighteenth-century movement, if a relatively small one), the politics of our present moment regularly invoke early American history to ground and legitimate their ethical, political, historical, and visionary claims. While this course is primarily an introduction to early American studies—an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the period that draws on scholarship in history, literature, and law, among other fields— the course is organized into three sections, organized around three themes (sovereignty, labor, and governance), and at the end of each section we engage twenty-first century political debates surrounding these themes. This course focuses on British colonial North America, and then the early national United States before 1865, but readings cluster around the long eighteenth century. Topics may include the histories, geographies and politics of Native nations prior to the incursion of Europeans into the region; the labor cultures of bondage (chattel slavery) and indenture; anti-government, anti-monarchical and revolutionary movements; the legal architecture of Native dispossession; the beginnings of nationalist imperialism; the politics of democratic governance; regional, religion-based, and culturally-specific formations of gendered and sexual comportment; visual and/or literary arts of the era; abolitionist movements (temperance, anti-slavery); the creation of citizenship infrastructures as well as those controlling immigration and naturalization; and contemporary visions of what “Americanness” meant, looked like, or represented.

We consider in what way these phenomena served as historical ruptures, and in what other ways we see continuities threaded across the centuries and across diverse locales. At the same time, we learn how vibrant this world was, where political configurations changed and developed, intellectuals battled with essential questions about the nature of God, and the fundaments of the modern world were laid.

The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events.

We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking.

    "Course Descrpition": "This course aims to provide students with an alternative reading of the Islamic legal tradition. It upends the view that Islamic law was in some way allergic to change. Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence ( fiqh ), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God’s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions ( fatwā s) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course challenges students to ask what is change within a tradition? In the debates and polemics of legal scholars, we contemplate the appeal and the limitations of reform within Islamic law, tracing how both have been contested and have evolved across different geographies and periods in the Muslim World. Likewise, we rethink the boundaries of continuity. We question how a legal school and a legal canon are constructed and revised, examining the ways in which both are capable of reinforcing – or imperiling – the Islamic legal tradition. Last, we explore the endurance of Islamic law in contemporary Muslim societies. The course reflects on the processes and the consequences of various projects of “modernizing” the Sharīʿa, asking how the institutions of the colonial and postcolonial state have reconfigured Islamic law in radically different ways.

We look at the history of our very idea of the fetus and consider how we got here. Each of us may have a different idea of what the fetus is, but every one of those ideas has a particular history.

Initially, European colonists enslaved indigenous peoples wherever possible, yet by the late sixteenth century the enslavement of Africans had become far more common. We focus upon North American and the Caribbean, where European colonists developed sophisticated agricultural enterprises that produced for export to the European market and were completely dependent upon the enslaved labor of Africans. An enormous ocean commerce trafficked almost twelve million enslaved captives from the Atlantic coasts of Africa to work on the plantations of the Americas. The commerce in tobacco, sugar, rum, and cotton enabled these colonies to develop.

From calls for decolonization and repatriation to protests over human remains collections and unethical donor policies, museums and related cultural institutions find themselves at a crossroads, reckoning with their violent colonial histories while handling ongoing concerns about workers’ rights, systemic inequality, and their role in shaping knowledge in the public sphere. Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it’s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History’s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss. We bridge the classroom and the collection, visiting institutions around New Haven, practicing skills like provenance research and ethical handling of difficult objects while working towards a practice-based final project that suggests ways forward for museums and collections.

In this course we will reflect on the relation between Galileo’s anti-Aristotelian physics and Hobbes’ system by reading key texts by Galileo and Hobbes along with an array of interpretations and criticisms of Hobbes that will serve to situate Hobbes in early modern currents of thought in science, religion and politics, while at the same time situating us in contemporary ideological debates about the origins of modernity.

These changes influenced the perceptions, uses, and the ways different groups experienced nocturnal time, and how we act, sleep, work, interact, and even dream. The traditional binary view of day and night is questioned by presenting a more complex \"and dynamic face\" of the night. Nightfall provides multiple opportunities for dissent and rebellion and becomes an ideal space for marginal and subordinate people. Historical analysis, literary texts, medical and scientific writings, and primary sources provide the class with a cross-disciplinary approach to examine how the night became the abode of the ghost, the devil, the witch, and the dead, and how the night became criminalized, commercialized and even politicized. In our time, improvements in lighting changed the nocturnal world, but also had detrimental effects on sleep and dreams, and caused contemporary movements–aesthetic and scientific–to \"rescue\" the night.

With these questions in mind, the course first reconsiders the emergence of citizenship, mass enfranchisement, and the nation-state model in the final third of the 19th century against the backdrop of the massive migration flows occurring across the continent. It examines the construction of racial hierarchies and its significance for changing conceptions of citizenship, particularly within the context of the French imperial rule. The course then turns to the two world wars and the population displacements they produced, crises which resulted in the creation of new institutions of international governance, the League of Nations and the United Nations, to manage the new populations of displaced persons and the stateless. It looks at the legacy of eugenics, empire, and National Socialism for thinking about race, citizenship, and disability after the Second World War.

    "Course Descrpition": "Francis of Assisi is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in European history. As one of Catholicism’s most revered saints (often considered to be the greatest male saint ever), his radical message of voluntary poverty, humility and fraternity significantly revived the Catholic church in a moment of profound crisis, and has since been accepted as one of the foundational elements of European thought, receiving universal admiration from diverse thinkers who are often unaffiliated with the Catholic tradition. This course seeks to take both challenges head on. Its pedagogical intent is three-fold. First, by offering a comprehensive overview of the layered accumulation of narratives that has given us the Francis figure so beloved today, it encourages students to examine the ambiguous boundaries of “reliability” with regard to historical narratives, especially those with a mythopoetic flavor. Other than the well-known “Little Flowers”, students are also exposed to less-known “lives” of the saint and are expected to critically compare these sources. Second, students are invited to Socratically wrestle with Francis’ spiritual legacy in light of its obvious conflict with prevalent notions of the “good life” in contemporary America. Third, students will gain a robust understanding of the Franciscan tradition which has left its footprint in vast regions outside of Europe (Jerusalem, East Asia, the Americas), has generated an important school of theology, and continues to stoke prominent public debates through controversial modern figures such as Padre Pio. Background readings on medieval religious history will also be provided. Topics will include orthodoxy and heresy, factional conflict within religious orders, missionary activities, mysticism, female religious life, and faith and the visual arts.

The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events.

We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking.

Our point of departure is the idea that gender constitutes a “useful category of historical analysis” (Joan Scott). In this course we ask how deviant gender expression can be a category of historical analysis. How do we write history from the perspective of gender fluidity, non-binarism, and gender transgression? How can this history give us the tools to critique regnant norms of gender expression, then and now? How does this historical approach relate to trans* and non-binary people & movements today?

This seminar introduces students to the field of global history through a study of ideas of world order in the twentieth century. As the Eurocentric world order of the nineteenth century was shattered by global conflicts, competing worldmaking projects arose, prompting intellectuals and social scientists to race to comprehend them. The identification or declaration of a certain emerging order was often also a political intervention. Thus, to study the trajectory of the world order in the last century, we need a combined toolkit of international history and intellectual history. After surveying the political and intellectual impacts of the world wars, we will pay special attention to the twin processes of Cold War and decolonization, their origins and their aftermath. Through topics such as war and revolution, modernization and development, nationalism and capitalist globalization, students will be equipped to think critically about contemporary questions: Are we entering a new Cold War? Is empire a thing of the past? Can history inform foreign policy? We will also pay attention to world order as intellectually experienced by historical actors, especially experiences of disorder and imaginations of a new world in an eventful century. With travelers, novelists, and social scientists as well as statesmen as our guides, we will dwell on how moments of crisis and rupture such as global wars and violence, imperial dissolution, and the rapid, uneven development of capitalism gave rise to not only new institutional experiments but also new forms of subjectivity and imagination, all of which help make any idea of order plausible.

How does that history influence our collective lives in the present, and what are some alternatives? This course gives students a background in the development of sex science, from evolutionary arguments that racialized sexual dimorphism to the contemporary technologies that claim to be able to get at bodily truths that are supposedly more real than identity. It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer.

By analyzing methodologies like classification, conservation, and scientific communication, we will discuss how divisions between the “natural” and “unnatural” were created in western cultures along unequal ideas about human bodies. Critical analyses of sources across multiple disciplines will inform conversations about knowledge production with the goal of interrogating how these power structures have silenced voices and enacted long-lasting violences on both environments and the peoples inhabiting them. Using both primary and secondary sources while conducting original research, students will learn how binary and reductive categories have been used and abused in colonial science and beyond.

The course examines and conceptualizes how the Middle East figured in European imperial projects in the Western Hemisphere. It starts with the Papal sanction of Spanish and Portuguese colonial projects in the Americas as a continuation of their expulsion of the Moors from Iberia and proceeds to examine the histories of enslaved Black Muslims. A visit to the Beinecke Library and the Yale Archives to examine Ezra Stiles’ collection of Hebrew and Arabic texts and the ‘moorish’ identity of the boy he enslaved brings our inquiry closer to home. Additional visits to the archives of American missionary societies active in the Middle East, which are housed at the Yale Divinity School, invites students to examine primary sources linking Yale and New Haven to the Middle East.

    "Course Descrpition": "The economic rise of Asia—and especially of China and India—has coincided with a resurgence in historical research on the concept of “capitalism.” Over the past twenty years, historians of capitalism have situated the origins of capitalist transformation in global forces and processes. Yet this body of scholarship has largely focused on North America, Western Europe, and the Atlantic world. This seminar aims to elucidate how an integration of modern Asian history into global histories of capitalism might challenge existing historical models of economic life. How are we to understand the relationship of Asia—and different regions within Asia—to capitalism? Is capitalism a long-term tendency in the societies of early modern Asia, or is it a set of external arrangements superimposed upon local settings? What is the relationship between capitalism and the social organization of South, Southeast, and East Asian societies? This seminar anchors these questions in two main areas of focus: the role of environmental variables in histories of capitalism in Asia; and the centrality of migration in networks of labor, commerce and specialization. We will explore these questions through a series of topics including: the pre-colonial trading world of the Indian Ocean; arguments about industrialization and the “Great Divergence” in the nineteenth century; continuities and transformations under colonialism; nationalism, decolonization, and competing visions for developmentalism; as well as neoliberalism and the energy transition.

Throughout the semester, we consider a controversial question: is it possible to understand the history of art and science as a more-than-human story?

At the same time, we explore how makers across cultures approached the natural world as a locus of the divine, a source of inspiration, and the ground for both scientific inquiry and the pursuit of self-knowledge. The very notions of art and artistic creation are impossible to define without recourse to nature as both a concept and a site of lived experience.

From calls for decolonization and repatriation to protests over human remains collections and unethical donor policies, museums and related cultural institutions find themselves at a crossroads, reckoning with their violent colonial histories while handling ongoing concerns about workers’ rights, systemic inequality, and their role in shaping knowledge in the public sphere. Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it’s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History’s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss.

Is originality a value to defend, or is it a resource claimed by some and denied to others? How have our increasingly sophisticated technical capacities for reproduction, replication, and most recently, generation, tested our intuitions about originality? Facing a seeming infinity of sources, as well as their forceful algorithmic channeling, what is original work today? Themes include: authorship and authenticity, sources and influence, anachronism and pseudomorphism, seriality, reproduction, appropriation and citation, style and similitude. HU T 9:25am-11:15am"

The movement of things in space and time offers valuable insights into the waxing and waning of maritime and terrestrial networks that fostered transregional connectivity. This course introduces students to a variety of objects from premodern East Asia with a view to understanding the histories of intercultural exchange inscribed into their designs, materials, and itineraries. It begins by familiarizing students with methodologies, interpretive frameworks, and critical vocabulary for studying interconnected material cultures. The rest of the course is organized as a series of case studies on specific object types and structured into four modules, each focusing on a different sphere of exchange defined by shared geography, trade, religion, or ecosystem. Through this diverse group of objects, we will explore the entanglement of material culture with evolving structures of power, networks of interregional and long-distance exchange, and the physical environment in East Asia.

While this period is celebrated for its artistic, cultural, and intellectual achievements, it also had its fair share of intrigue, corruption, and moral complexities. Through love poems, secret letters, intricate networks, and political conspiracies, the course paints a vivid picture of the social and cultural landscape of Renaissance and early modern Italy. We look at the complex figure of Michelangelo, both as an artist and poet, focusing on his queer relationship with Tommaso de’ Cavalieri and his friendship with Vittoria Colonna. We then discuss how Renaissance art, often commissioned by powerful individuals–such as Isabella D’Este’s patronage of Leonardo da Vinci–was used to promote political or social agendas. We examine the alliances, betrayals, and murders that took place in Renaissance courts and how they shaped the political arena. Topics include the assassination of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s brother, Caterina de’ Medici’s agency, and Borgia’s rise to power as well as the use of poison as a political instrument in power struggles and schemes to eliminate rivals. The course highlights radical and sharp-witted women writers, such as Moderata Fonte and Arcangela Tarabotti, who protested against a patriarchal society, and gave voice to those who challenged gender norms. By uncovering these compelling narratives through the intersection of literature, religion, history, art, and sexuality, the course offers a more nuanced and critical view on this acclaimed era.

It addresses a set of themes whose point of entry is the entangled character of visual production and reception in Japan at a tipping point in the emergence of global modernity, when what were called the Nanbans—“Southern Barbarians,” i.e. Europeans—began to arrive in Japan. The question of whether or not much-theorized nomenclatures such as baroque , rococo , mestizo , and even global modernity are pertinent to analysis from the Japanese and Asian perspective constitutes the backbone of the course and its primary objective in the study of a corpus of visual materials spanning the European and Asian cultural spheres. As such the seminar is not only about Japan, per se, or about Japanese objects, or the shogunal eye. It is equally about how Japan and Japanese objects and materials, along with objects and materials from other places, figured in a greater community of exchange, friction, confrontation, conquest, and adaptation in times when Portuguese marauders, Jesuit missionaries, Muslim traders, and Japanese pirates found themselves in the same waters, on ships laden with goods, making landfall in the domains of Japan’s great military hegemons.

Questions about reproduction–and about not reproducing–are deeply tied to questions of gendered and racial rights; of bodily autonomy; of American expansion and empire; and of who counts as a citizen, or even as a human being. In the past few years, we’ve encountered new stories about everything from new and restrictive abortion laws, to immigrant woman who were sterilized without their consent, to new technologies in male birth control, to the inequitable childcare burden that falls to women during times of hardship, to the racist roots of foster care and residential school systems. In this course, we come to understand the historical changes in American reproduction to better understand the complicated roots of our current moment. By analyzing articles in newspapers and scientific journals, advertisements, film, patient and physician narratives, and exhibitions and material culture, students will understand reproduction as a site for empowerment and activism, as a site of medical professionalization, and as a site of health disparity. We examine reproduction capaciously, including pregnancy and childbirth, birth control and abortion, assistive reproductive technologies, and adoption and foster care. Our analysis is intersectional, and we consider what different identities meant for reproduction historically, as well as in our current moment. HU 0 Course cr HTBA"

Students learn to work with the methods of history of science: we analyze science as a social and material process bound to the cultural and epistemological particularities of its historical context, and we examine the political dimensions of historical narratives about the emergence of the theory of global warming. Via hands-on experience with Yale’s historical collections, students learn to analyze maps, artifacts, and instruments as historical sources.

Throughout the semester, we consider a controversial question: is it possible to understand the history of art and science as a more-than-human story? Challenging traditional narratives of human progress, we attend to episodes of invention and destruction in equal measure. We discuss how art history is inseparable from histories of extracted resources, exploited species, environmental catastrophe, racialized and gendered understandings of the ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, and politicized understandings of land as power. At the same time, we explore how makers across cultures approached the natural world as a locus of the divine, a source of inspiration, and the ground for both scientific inquiry and the pursuit of self-knowledge. The very notions of art and artistic creation are impossible to define without recourse to nature as both a concept and a site of lived experience.

    "Course Descrpition": "Penetrated jungles, “mother” nature, and quests to preserve the redwoods – for hundreds of years, colonial agents have characterized environments in racialized, gendered, sexualized, classist, and ableist terms, anthropomorphizing nature along ongoing systems of inequality.  This class traces shifting conceptualizations of nature from the early modern period to the present, focusing on how naturalists and scientists have described, collected, and displayed “new” environments and peoples while building extractive and exploitative natural history collections, from cabinets of curiosity to Yale’s own Peabody Museum. By analyzing methodologies like classification, conservation, and scientific communication, we will discuss how divisions between the “natural” and “unnatural” were created in western cultures along unequal ideas about human bodies. Critical analyses of sources across multiple disciplines will inform conversations about knowledge production with the goal of interrogating how these power structures have silenced voices and enacted long-lasting violences on both environments and the peoples inhabiting them. Using both primary and secondary sources while conducting original research, students will learn how binary and reductive categories have been used and abused in colonial science and beyond. This class will include visits to museums around Yale’s campus and beyond, with two of your assignments focused on the Peabody Museum. WR , HU W 3:30pm-5:20pm"

    "Course Descrpition": "Museums are in a state of crisis. From calls for decolonization and repatriation to protests over human remains collections and unethical donor policies, museums and related cultural institutions find themselves at a crossroads, reckoning with their violent colonial histories while handling ongoing concerns about workers’ rights, systemic inequality, and their role in shaping knowledge in the public sphere. Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it’s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History’s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss. We bridge the classroom and the collection, visiting institutions around New Haven, practicing skills like provenance research and ethical handling of difficult objects while working towards a practice-based final project that suggests ways forward for museums and collections.

How have colonial depictions of Asia and Africa as racialized geographies continued to shape migration policies and humanitarian practices throughout the twentieth century? In this seminar, we explore how states and humanitarian actors have utilized technologies of surveillance and control to govern the lives and movements of migrants and refugees throughout the twentieth century. We consider the multifarious reasons why communities, especially throughout Asia, have been mobile since the beginning of the nineteenth century and how this mobility has been shaped through colonial biomedical regimes. Critically interrogating Western images of Global South refugees seeking asylum in the Global North, we investigate contemporary gendered and racialized images of the “good refugee” or migrant who “deserve” consideration in the modern humanitarian system through biomedical categories. Students are expected to apply historical insights to contemporary debates surrounding surveillance, citizenship, and the global migration regime, challenging prevailing narratives and exploring alternative perspectives on refugee surveillance regimes.

One’s fetal politics likely predicts a lot about how they live their life, vote, worship, and even about how they understand themselves. How, then, has the fetus come to carry the cultural significance that it does? Are there other ways one might think of the fetus? And what is happening in the background when we center the fetus up front? This course examines the many cultural meanings of the fetus in American life: from a clump of cells, to a beloved family member, to political litmus test, and considers the way that these different meanings are connected to questions of human and civil rights, gender relations, bodily autonomy, and political life. We look at the history of our very idea of the fetus and consider how we got here. Each of us may have a different idea of what the fetus is, but every one of those ideas has a particular history.

We explore how science in colonial India was intertwined with anticolonialism, and examine anticolonial arguments against famines using modern economic sciences. In the second part, we explore pluralist practices of medicine in colonial South Asia and analyze how diverse approaches of colonial Indian medical practitioners blur the categories of “traditional” and “modern” medicine. We then focus on colonial and postcolonial public health interventions—including, regulating poisons and adulterated food, population control, and vaccination campaigns—and their contestations.

What is the thread that connects the Jedi knights of Star Wars and those that sat around king Arthur’s round table? How did medieval history and Renaissance poetry inform the expanded universes of superhero movies and fantasy literature, along with the inexhaustible fan-fiction that further extends and queers them? Chivalry, as a code of conduct and a network of symbols, inspired some of the most entertaining stories of the so-called Western canon, blurring the divide between high and popular culture.

    "Course Descrpition": "The course \"Unequal\" examines the historical roots of intolerance, slavery, and imperialism, emphasizing how our perceptions of history shape contemporary beliefs and policies. It challenges the notion that inequality is an inevitable outcome of societal complexity, positing that historical narratives often frame progress and freedom while obscuring themes of inequality. By investigating early human history, the course aims to unpack the concepts of identity, possession, value, freedom, and power, exploring their impact on modern society. Rather than focusing on specific literature or chronological period, \"Unequal\" centers around critical questions about human culture. The course employs innovative experimental lab assignments, allowing students to engage with the past creatively, such as cooking ancient recipes, brewing beer, and creating virtual museum exhibits. This interdisciplinary approach encourages a deeper understanding of the historical context that informs present-day issues, inviting students to rethink common narratives and assumptions about equality and progress. Ultimately, the course aims to foster critical thinking about the interplay between history and contemporary society. HU , SO 0 Course cr TTh 11:35am-12:50pm"

We’ approach this period of music history by delving into how “regular people”—especially women—consumed, curated, and created music in their everyday lives. Austen, an accomplished musician herself, wove music into her novels in ways that reveal much about contemporary practices of (and prejudices against) musicking. We focus on three of Austen’s novels ( Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility, Emma ) and excerpts from her music manuscript collections, alongside recent scholarship and modern film adaptations, which taken together raise a series of interdisciplinary questions. By learning about Austen's musical milieu, we open up the musical lives of Regency-era women and the \"middling sort,\" while becoming more attuned to the social critiques embedded in Austen's representations of music, ultimately enriching our engagement with the novels themselves.

We spend the first part of the course considering the theoretical origins of the doppelgänger in gothic literature, turning to concepts of “the self and other” from psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial theory to help us think broadly through the category. In the second part of the course, we read works of literature that feature encounters with a large cast of doppelgänger sub-types, including alter-egos, shadows, ghosts, and evil twins. Finally, we revisit the doppelgänger trope in the digital age to interrogate how advanced technologies have altered the possibilities for “doubling” through innovations such as AI, cloning, and biogenetic de-extinction projects.

    "Course Descrpition": "It is generally agreed that modern political science begins with Machiavelli, but what that means remains a subject of considerable dispute.  What were Machiavelli’s accomplishments?  Was he a political realist who taught us to seek for “the effectual truth” of things?  Was he an advisor to princes or, at the very least, powerful executives who taught the importance of acting by “oneself alone”?  Was he a populist who sought to reanimate a taste for Roman-style republicanism?  Or did he seek to bring about a new kind of expansive territorial state fuelled by war and the desire for empire?  Machiavelli’s influence has been widespread throughout the modern world.  But just because his writings have been used and misused for a range of causes does not mean that we cannot discover an intelligible and coherent core to his work. We read Machiavelli’s two most important works of political theory–the Prince and the Discourses on Livy . The latter is read along with the Roman historian Titus Livy who was Machiavelli’s major source for his theories of political conflict, leadership, and liberty. We then consider his influence on some selected nineteenth and twentieth-century political theorists who have appropriated him as the central figure of modernity.

While this period is celebrated for its artistic, cultural, and intellectual achievements, it also had its fair share of intrigue, corruption, and moral complexities. Through love poems, secret letters, intricate networks, and political conspiracies, the course paints a vivid picture of the social and cultural landscape of Renaissance and early modern Italy. We look at the complex figure of Michelangelo, both as an artist and poet, focusing on his queer relationship with Tommaso de’ Cavalieri and his friendship with Vittoria Colonna. We then discuss how Renaissance art, often commissioned by powerful individuals–such as Isabella D’Este’s patronage of Leonardo da Vinci–was used to promote political or social agendas. We examine the alliances, betrayals, and murders that took place in Renaissance courts and how they shaped the political arena. Topics include the assassination of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s brother, Caterina de’ Medici’s agency, and Borgia’s rise to power as well as the use of poison as a political instrument in power struggles and schemes to eliminate rivals. The course highlights radical and sharp-witted women writers, such as Moderata Fonte and Arcangela Tarabotti, who protested against a patriarchal society, and gave voice to those who challenged gender norms.

The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson's sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel are complemented by relevant short readings on theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required.

A full range of media provide protection against what appears to be a threatening milieu. However, protection has a cost in terms of values and habits. It requires identifying and even materializing a threat and an enemy; it implies a step back from the direct experience of reality and others; and ultimately it idealizes a safe world. But is the world ready to be safe? Is the enemy a necessary invention? Is security guaranteed to all? And ultimately, is protection the only remedy for our fears? This seminar addresses such questions. HU T 9:25am-11:15am, M 4:30pm-6:30pm"

    "Course Descrpition": "Although we spend approximately one third of our lives asleep, since the industrial revolution and the emergence of uninterrupted city lighting, industrialized societies seem to have developed an ambivalent relation to sleep: both protected and devalued for the sake of higher standards of productive work. The devaluation of sleep, in particular, has produced, during the twentieth and the first two decades of the twenty-first centuries, an array of social, political, and medical discourses to study the impact of changing patterns of sleep and sleeplessness at the global level. This seminar studies topics in the politics and cultures of sleep and sleeplessness, which posit sleep as a human practice. As any human practice, it is framed by cultural and political settings, so that how, when, why, where, and who sleeps vary across sectors of society, across past and present and across world cultures. We study historical, literary, philosophical, sociological, political, and filmic texts. A cultural, social, and political understanding of sleep and sleeplessness can reveal how sleep has been transformed into a bodily site upon which social values are imposed, social surveillance is enacted, ideas about “normality” are instrumentalized, resulting in a demand that humans adapt to human-made changing conditions of production, rather than universally unchanging health needs.

It is strange that this framing has been taken for granted, given that all three of them took a critical stance against philosophy, aligning themselves instead with disciplines that they attempted to revolutionize or invent – political economy, philology, and psychoanalysis. This course takes up Ricoeur’s configuration just as these authors ask us to: with suspicion. We will, on the one hand, ask what the three have in common, how they teach us to doubt even the foundations of our own doubt and to construct systems that remain fundamentally open to revision. On the other hand, we will also examine the differences among the three: their contrasting histories, methods, and purposes. Finally, we will ask how these texts and authors come to us, how our own assumptions shape our engagement with them, and how we might learn from them today.

This course looks at AI and explore its relation with culture in a threefold way: through (i) historicizing (by looking at the historical cultural conditions that enabled or facilitated certain habits of thought or régimes of truth that led to present-day AI); (ii) analogizing (by tracing the similarities between patterns of expression in culture and developments in AI); and (iii) contextualizing (tracing how cultural artifacts have influenced AI’s directions and vice versa).

Throughout the semester, we consider a controversial question: is it possible to understand the history of art and science as a more-than-human story? Challenging traditional narratives of human progress, we attend to episodes of invention and destruction in equal measure. We discuss how art history is inseparable from histories of extracted resources, exploited species, environmental catastrophe, racialized and gendered understandings of the ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, and politicized understandings of land as power. At the same time, we explore how makers across cultures approached the natural world as a locus of the divine, a source of inspiration, and the ground for both scientific inquiry and the pursuit of self-knowledge. The very notions of art and artistic creation are impossible to define without recourse to nature as both a concept and a site of lived experience.

What is the thread that connects the Jedi knights of Star Wars and those that sat around king Arthur’s round table? How did medieval history and Renaissance poetry inform the expanded universes of superhero movies and fantasy literature, along with the inexhaustible fan-fiction that further extends and queers them? Chivalry, as a code of conduct and a network of symbols, inspired some of the most entertaining stories of the so-called Western canon, blurring the divide between high and popular culture.

While this period is celebrated for its artistic, cultural, and intellectual achievements, it also had its fair share of intrigue, corruption, and moral complexities. Through love poems, secret letters, intricate networks, and political conspiracies, the course paints a vivid picture of the social and cultural landscape of Renaissance and early modern Italy. We look at the complex figure of Michelangelo, both as an artist and poet, focusing on his queer relationship with Tommaso de’ Cavalieri and his friendship with Vittoria Colonna. We then discuss how Renaissance art, often commissioned by powerful individuals–such as Isabella D’Este’s patronage of Leonardo da Vinci–was used to promote political or social agendas. We examine the alliances, betrayals, and murders that took place in Renaissance courts and how they shaped the political arena. Topics include the assassination of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s brother, Caterina de’ Medici’s agency, and Borgia’s rise to power as well as the use of poison as a political instrument in power struggles and schemes to eliminate rivals. The course highlights radical and sharp-witted women writers, such as Moderata Fonte and Arcangela Tarabotti, who protested against a patriarchal society, and gave voice to those who challenged gender norms. By uncovering these compelling narratives through the intersection of literature, religion, history, art, and sexuality, the course offers a more nuanced and critical view on this acclaimed era.

    "Course Descrpition": "Francis of Assisi is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in European history. As one of Catholicism’s most revered saints (often considered to be the greatest male saint ever), his radical message of voluntary poverty, humility and fraternity significantly revived the Catholic church in a moment of profound crisis, and has since been accepted as one of the foundational elements of European thought, receiving universal admiration from diverse thinkers who are often unaffiliated with the Catholic tradition. This course seeks to take both challenges head on. Its pedagogical intent is three-fold. First, by offering a comprehensive overview of the layered accumulation of narratives that has given us the Francis figure so beloved today, it encourages students to examine the ambiguous boundaries of “reliability” with regard to historical narratives, especially those with a mythopoetic flavor. Other than the well-known “Little Flowers”, students are also exposed to less-known “lives” of the saint and are expected to critically compare these sources. Second, students are invited to Socratically wrestle with Francis’ spiritual legacy in light of its obvious conflict with prevalent notions of the “good life” in contemporary America. Third, students will gain a robust understanding of the Franciscan tradition which has left its footprint in vast regions outside of Europe (Jerusalem, East Asia, the Americas), has generated an important school of theology, and continues to stoke prominent public debates through controversial modern figures such as Padre Pio. Background readings on medieval religious history will also be provided. Topics will include orthodoxy and heresy, factional conflict within religious orders, missionary activities, mysticism, female religious life, and faith and the visual arts.

Though the practice of castration has a long and complicated global history, the Italian term castrato denotes a particular group of people within that history: the many thousands of Italian boys, mostly from poor families, who were subjected to surgery between 1550 and 1850 with the express purpose of altering their voices for music-making. As the most celebrated performers of vocal music in early modern Europe, castrati were adored, worshipped, and heaped with wealth—but also mocked, shunned, and denied basic human rights.

The course aims to provide an introduction and a broad overview of Italian literature and culture from the Duecento to the Renaissance, specifically focusing on authors such as Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Ariosto, and literary and artistic movements such as Humanism and Renaissance. These authors and their masterpieces are introduced through readings, works of art, listening materials, videos, and films.

    "Course Descrpition": "Landscape and the natural environment have never occupied “background” status in Italian film. Given the spectacular visual presence of its terrain—thanks to the relative proximity of mountain chains and the long seacoast—and given the pivotal importance of farming and pasturage in this traditionally agrarian economy, the synergy between the human and natural worlds has played a prominent role in Italian filmmaking since the very inception of the industry. Most recently, two developments have pushed this issue to the forefront of scholarly attention: the advent of ecocriticism, which found one of its earliest and most influential champions in Serenella Iovino, and the establishment of regional film commissions, grassroots production centers that sponsored cinematic works attuned to the specificity of “the local.” The course includes study of films that predate our current environmental consciousness, as well as recent films that foreground it in narrative terms. In the case of the older films, which have already attracted a great deal of critical commentary over time, we work to shift our interpretive frame in an “eco-friendly” direction (even when the films’ characters are hardly friends of the environment). Among the films considered are Le quattro volte, Il vento fa il suo giro, L’uomo che verrà, Gomorra, L’albero degli zoccoli, Riso amaro, Red Desert , Christ Stopped at Eboli, and Il ladro di bambini . We screen one film a week and devote our seminars to close analysis of the works in question. HU W 3:30pm-5:20pm, M 7:30pm-10:30pm"

We examine the way in which writers and artists struggled with these issues in five media: memoir, theology, history, fiction, and painting, thereby creating Jewish versions first of Enlightenment, Romanticism, and realism (1780-1870) and then of nationalism, positivism, and modernism (1870-1930).

Though touching on specific national political parties, institutions, and think tanks, its focus is on mapping the intellectual overlap and differences between various right-wing ideologies.

For some institutions – such as the Roman baths – Martial is our only substantial source of evidence in Latin literature.

Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization?  Prerequisite: SPAN 140 or 145, or in accordance with placement results.

This course delves into the concept of language crises and its long history from a philosophical and literary perspective, examining how crises of language are represented in literature and how they reflect broader philosophical questions about language, identity, and power. We explore different philosophical approaches to language, such as the history of language and philology (Herder, Humboldt, Nietzsche), structuralism and post-structuralism (Saussure), analytical and pragmatic philosophies (Wittgenstein), phenomenology and deconstruction (Heidegger), and analyze how these theories shape our understanding of language while simultaneously evoking its crisis. The course also examines how such language crises are represented and produced in literature and the arts; how authors and artists approach the complexities of language loss, and how crises help birth alternative systems of signification. Through close readings of literary texts by Hofmannsthal, Musil, Bachmann, et. al., we analyze the symbolic and metaphorical significance of language crises, as well as the ethical and political implications of language loss for (cultural) identity. Experimental use of language such as DaDa artwork, performance cultures, and “Sprachspiel” poetry by the “Wiener Gruppe,” as well as contemporary KI/AI literature, further complement the theoretical readings.

There are many properties of language that make it challenging to handle computationally: First, language is ambiguous - a given word or sentence can have many possible meanings. Second, our linguistic experience is sparse - many aspects of language (e.g., certain sentence structures) occur very rarely, posing a challenge for computational systems that learn from data. Third, language has an enormous amount of hidden structure - words and other linguistic units can have complex relationships with each other that are not apparent on the surface. In this course, we explore the computational approaches that can overcome these challenges. Topics include finite state tools, neural networks, Bayesian approaches, computational morphology and phonology, grammar and parsing, lexical semantics, and the use of linguistic models in applied problems.

Highlighting how gender and sexual minorities, and the gendered regulation of life, more broadly, both animate and contest colonial legacies tied to a racialized notion of “modernity.” Through ethnography, history, and literature, students confront a political economy of intimacies that continuously reshape what it means to be or not to be a citizen. Our approach extends beyond borders and laws to include the everyday acts of citizenship that rework race, religion, and ethnicity across transnational fronts. We discuss how people navigate their lives in the everyday, from the ordinary poetry of identity and belonging to the spectacular drama of war and conflict. Our goal is to challenge orientalist legacies that dismiss theoretical insights from scholarship on and from this region by labeling it as focused on exceptional cases instead of addressing “universal” issues. Instead, we take seriously that the specific historical and social contexts of the Middle East and North Africa reveal how connections based on gender and sexuality within and across families and social classes are deeply entwined with racial narratives of state authority and political sovereignty on a global scale.

Imagine the ocean spiking a fever: cold-blooded organisms of all shapes, sizes and complexities struggle to survive when water temperatures go up 2-4 degrees. Some organisms adapt to extremes, while others cannot. Predicted and observed changes in temperature, pH and salt concentration do and will affect many parameters of the living world, from the kinetics of chemical reactions and cellular signaling pathways to the accumulation of unforeseen chemicals in the environment, the appearance and dispersal of new diseases, and the development of new foods. In this course, we approach climate change from the molecular point of view, identifying how cells and organisms – from microbes to plants and animals – respond to changing environmental conditions. To embrace the concept of “one health” for all life on the planet, this course leverages biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biophysics, and genetics to develop an understanding of the impact of climate change on the living world. We consider the foundational knowledge that biochemistry can bring to the table as we meet the challenge of climate change.

By charting songs’ engagement with intellectual currents and movements such as courtly love, affective theology, sexual libertinism, Romanticism, feminism, and the LGBTQ rights movement, the course serves to situate contemporary ideas about desire and its artistic expression within the history of social constructions of such desire.

We’ approach this period of music history by delving into how “regular people”—especially women—consumed, curated, and created music in their everyday lives. Austen, an accomplished musician herself, wove music into her novels in ways that reveal much about contemporary practices of (and prejudices against) musicking. We focus on three of Austen’s novels ( Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility, Emma ) and excerpts from her music manuscript collections, alongside recent scholarship and modern film adaptations, which taken together raise a series of interdisciplinary questions. By learning about Austen's musical milieu, we open up the musical lives of Regency-era women and the \"middling sort,\" while becoming more attuned to the social critiques embedded in Austen's representations of music, ultimately enriching our engagement with the novels themselves.

Though the practice of castration has a long and complicated global history, the Italian term castrato denotes a particular group of people within that history: the many thousands of Italian boys, mostly from poor families, who were subjected to surgery between 1550 and 1850 with the express purpose of altering their voices for music-making. As the most celebrated performers of vocal music in early modern Europe, castrati were adored, worshipped, and heaped with wealth—but also mocked, shunned, and denied basic human rights. These and other contradictions characterize the castrato’s fraught place within music history, while also resonating across time with twenty-first-century concerns about constructions of gender, sexuality, race, class, and (dis)ability.

Navigating social and political forces like the Great Migration and Black Consciousness, while weaving Black sacred tradition together with blues and hip-hop, figures like Thomas Dorsey, Sallie Martin, Mahalia Jackson, Rosetta Tharpe, Edwin Hawkins, and Kirk Franklin all understood themselves to be revolutionaries of sorts—an identity that brought with it both peril and possibility. Tracing this revolutionary thread through gospel’s history, this course attends to gospel’s distinctive combination of sound and belief through three interpretive lenses: exemplary performers, pivotal periods, and formal processes. This semester’s work brings material and approaches from the fields of musicology, music theory, ethnomusicology, black studies, homiletics, and theology to bear on three questions: 1) What work—musical, cultural, and spiritual—does gospel do for its various audiences? 2) How does the function of the gospel song shape its form? 3) What forms of resistance has gospel music rendered—within the church and outside it? Students immerse themselves in these dimensions of the “the gospel imagination” through a combination of weekly reading, listening and writing assignments, all of which culminates in a final composition project that will be workshopped in a masterclass with a leading gospel artist.

The history of murder, violence, and criminal investigation is as old as humankind. Yet, crime is not always considered evil, nor is evil always associated with crime. In this course, we discuss how the way evil was perceived and crime was punished has changed throughout history. From mythical accounts of murders, to real records of trials of humans, animals, and even objects accused of homicide or witchcraft, we analyze how aspects of social status or gender played a role in shaping punishment across Eastern and Western civilizations. We compare codified-law civilizations to those in which custom, social pressure, and community ethics determined correct behavior. Four historical cold cases with accompanying evidence are presented for in-class debate, and… perhaps students may be able to help solve an old mystery! At the end of the semester, we recreate historical trials using the same crime, evidence, and participants, but following the law and procedures of each one of the historical settings covered in this course. Will the verdict and sentence be any different? Friday sessions alternate between writing workshops and field trips to Yale collections.  Enrollment limited to first-year students.

It challenges the notion that inequality is an inevitable outcome of societal complexity, positing that historical narratives often frame progress and freedom while obscuring themes of inequality. By investigating early human history, the course aims to unpack the concepts of identity, possession, value, freedom, and power, exploring their impact on modern society. Rather than focusing on specific literature or chronological period, \"Unequal\" centers around critical questions about human culture. The course employs innovative experimental lab assignments, allowing students to engage with the past creatively, such as cooking ancient recipes, brewing beer, and creating virtual museum exhibits. This interdisciplinary approach encourages a deeper understanding of the historical context that informs present-day issues, inviting students to rethink common narratives and assumptions about equality and progress.

What are our fundamental financial instruments and how and in what order where they developed? Are there fundamental rules behind the way in which humans conduct business? What roles have states and institutions historically played in facilitating or restricting trade? What sources and approaches are available to study trade in pre-modern times? Can business innovations from the past help us think about business in the present? To explore all these questions, this class draws upon data and case-studies drawn broadly from the ancient world but with focus on evidence from ancient Mesopotamia. With the benefit of a giant canvas of history we paint a detailed picture of how business developed through time. We look at examples where business was strictly regulated by state-controlled institutions as well as examples entrepreneurs would have to rely on informal enforcement mechanisms, such as kin-relationships and reputation in repeated interactions. We dive into the effects of shock on individuals and systems – from production shortages to pandemics. And we ask what happens when systems collapse, or value becomes immeasurable (as people have claimed for the 2008 crash). We study family-controlled business groups as an alternative to integrated and professionally managed corporations. And we observe how entrepreneurs adapted to face the financial challenges of states and dawning globalization.

Understanding the broad range of factors that can exacerbate or reduce stress, how we respond to stress, and the ways that experiences and effects of stress can differ across people and across stages of development can provide foundational insights for dealing with stress in our lives. This seminar integrates psychological, neurobiological, social, developmental, and clinical perspectives on stress. In addition to developing a foundation in the theoretical and empirical literature on stress, students will have the opportunity to engage in experiential learning related to coping skills drawn from evidence-based interventions in psychology.

Such infantile amnesia was first described a century ago and many theories have been proposed since then. However, there has been major empirical progress over the past decade. This seminar draws broadly on behavioral and neuroscientific research in humans and animals to understand infantile amnesia.

    "Course Descrpition": "This seminar aims to discuss the computational basis of seeing and thinking in the mind and brain. The course be organized around three central questions in brain and cognitive sciences. First, we start with this question of how perception gets us to cognition: How is it that perception transforms raw, unstructured incoming sensory signals arising from our physical environments -- the light that bounces off surfaces and arrives at the retina, raw audio waves hitting the ears, or the vibro-tactile sensations felt at the fingertips when touching a surface -- into things like objects, scenes, events, and agents, into things that we can think about? We draw upon readings and classroom discussions, primarily computational literature, to explore representational and algorithmic hypothesis about seeing and thinking in the mind. Second, we observe that these cognitive hypotheses about mental representations are typically developed in rather sterile, or as scientists we like to call it \"controlled\", settings. We proceed to ask how these cognitive hypotheses about mental representations can be scaled to the messiness and complexity of the real world. This leads us to issues at the intersection of AI, psychology, and cognitive science. Finally, we observe that in most cases, cognitive representations about mental representations don't plausibly or at least readily map onto a brain implementation. So, we ask: How is it that through the distributed and dynamic activity in our brain’s neural circuits, we come to think thoughts about objects and agents, mentally simulate what will happen next, and plan actions accordingly? We explore multi-level theories of intelligence, that make bridges across AI, neuroscience and cognitive science. SO W 9:25am-11:15am"

Finally, we will ask how these texts and authors come to us, how our own assumptions shape our engagement with them, and how we might learn from them today.

For example, do we have special obligations to our friends, family, or co-national? Are we epistemically permitted to ignore evidence if it indicates that our friend or family has done something wrong? Is there a conflict between what morality requires and what is required for being a good friend or family member? What’s wrong or bad about being friends with an immoral person?

In particular, we explore how these theories answer the following questions, “Is abortion morally permissible?”, “Is euthanasia morally wrong?”, “Should there be limits on free speech?

Simultaneously critical of American capitalism and of Soviet Communism, they were expelled from their native Germany in the wake of Hitler’s rise to power. They also often lacked any intellectual safe haven, finding themselves at odds much philosophical and social-scientific orthodoxy (positivism, neo-Kantianism, “value-free” social science etc.). The critical theorists of the Frankfurt School sought to re-actualize ideas from the philosophical tradition, especially from Kant and Hegel, in order to address the complex realities of modern society: mass culture; fascism, totalitarianism and authoritarianism; world war; imperialism; secularization; irrationality, sexuality and aggression; and so on.

The latter is read along with the Roman historian Titus Livy who was Machiavelli’s major source for his theories of political conflict, leadership, and liberty. We then consider his influence on some selected nineteenth and twentieth-century political theorists who have appropriated him as the central figure of modernity.

Is aging a mere biological process, or does it have deeper ethical and existential significance? Drawing from metaphysics, ethics, feminist philosophy, and critical age studies, we interrogate the ways age structures power, personhood, and our understanding of a life well lived.

    "Course Descrpition": "What does it mean to practice philosophy, and will having a philosophical practice enrich your life? This course centers these questions. We approach philosophy not just as a body of knowledge but as an active, lived practice that takes many forms. Through readings, dialogue, and exercises, we both theoretically examine and actively imitate a range of philosophical traditions and methods—from meditation to debate, and dialogue to personal letters. As we explore these ways of doing philosophy, we consider how the form of a philosophical practice shapes the ideas and arguments that come out of that practice. By the end of this course, you gain a deeper appreciation of philosophy as a multifaceted and multitudinous practice, as well as a clearer sense of how you can integrate philosophical practice into your own life.

There is now a second quantum revolution underway and a world-wide race to build powerful new types of computers based on quantum principles, and to develop new techniques for encrypted communication whose security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The approach of this course to these topics will strip away much of the traditional physics details to focus on the information content of quantum systems, the nature of measurement, and why the true randomness of certain measurement results can be a feature rather than a bug. We learn what it means for a quantum bit (‘qubit’) to be simultaneously 0 and 1 (in some sense). We learn about quantum entanglement and the associated ‘spooky action at a distance’ that convinced Einstein that the quantum theory must be wrong. Ironically, this bizarre effect is now used on a daily basis to prove that quantum mechanics is indeed correct and used as a routine engineering test to make sure that quantum computers are working properly and are truly quantum. Specific topics include: the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. Students learn to do problem sets based on programming and operating publicly-accessible cloud-based quantum computers. See for example: https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/.

    "Course Descrpition": "The first twenty-five years of the 20th century represent a turning point in human civilization as for the first time mankind achieved a systematic and predictive understanding of the atomic level constituents of matter and energy, and the mathematical laws which describe the interaction of these constituents. In addition, the General Theory of Relativity opened up for the first time a quantitative study of cosmology, of the history of the universe as a whole. Albert Einstein was at the center of these breakthroughs, and also became an iconic figure beyond physics, representing scientist genius engaged in pure research into the fundamental laws of nature. This course addresses the nature of the transition to modern physics, underpinned by quantum and relativity theory, through study of Einstein’s science, biography, and historical context. It also presents the basic concepts in electromagnetic theory, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, special theory of relativity, and quantum mechanics which were central to this revolutionary epoch in science.

First, looking beyond the region, this course considers debates on how to categorize political regimes and engages with theories of autocratic persistence around the globe. Moving back to the region, we trace the trajectories of different countries before and after 2010-2011. We then engage with how scholars situated the uprising within long-running debates on how historical and colonial legacies; cultural, ethnic, and religious practices and divides; contemporary patterns of foreign intervention; repression and coercion; economic resources; and contentious politics influence contemporary political outcomes in the region.

An aspiration of this course, as political as it is pedagogic, is that students approach their world-building projects with an enriched understanding of the ways gender, justice, and power shape and are shaped by institutions, inequality, and theory. Part I opens up some preliminary considerations of our course terms by investigating the case of abortion, abortion rights, and reproductive justice.  The topic is politically loaded, philosophically complex, and emotionally challenging; the point is not to convince you of the permissibility or impermissibility of abortion, but to explore how the contested case configures, imbricates, and puts pressure on our course terms. In Part II, we examine the historical and conceptual coordinates of the courses first three titular terms: is gender a subjective identification, social ascription, or axis of inequality? Is justice a matter of redistribution, recognition, resources, capabilities, or something more hedonic? Where is power located, or where does it circulate?

Our course of study includes the role of international stakeholders and multi-lateral institutions in the conflict, regional political and security dynamics and economic consequences. The humanitarian aspects of the war and its impact on civilian populations, human rights violations and the role of the media in shaping perceptions of the conflict is analyzed. Ultimately, what are the responsibilities of the international community in mitigating the human cost of conflict and the broader economic and policy implications?

As societies grow more complex and technology advances, so does the need for experts who have undergone years of specialized training. Ordinary citizens, firms, state bureaucracies, courts, and legislators constantly rely on experts to guide them in their decisions. However, this reliance is far from seamless. Opportunities to become a successful expert are uneven and often depend on circumstances beyond individual control. Specialists must counter public skepticism and compete with rival groups to establish their authority. Decision-makers are inundated with claims to expertise, making it challenging to discern between valid and dubious advice. Experts can exacerbate issues, fail catastrophically, or neglect public concerns to serve their own interests. Moreover, the increasingly specialized knowledge possessed by experts can seem esoteric and detached from everyday life, leader laypeople to view them with suspicion. For these reasons and others, the very notion of expertise has become highly politicized in recent years. Our society seems to be more and more divided between those who think that experts are indispensable to solve our problems, and those who see them as the root of our troubles.

The latter is read along with the Roman historian Titus Livy who was Machiavelli’s major source for his theories of political conflict, leadership, and liberty. We then consider his influence on some selected nineteenth and twentieth-century political theorists who have appropriated him as the central figure of modernity.

The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people.

It examines the emergence of republicanism, constitutionalism, nationalism, capitalism, socialism, feminism and the movements and political projects these ideas formed across Europe and North America. The seminar offers a “from above” and a “from below” view of the Age of Revolution, examining how it influenced, shaped, and reshaped both the states and their societies. It aims to familiarize the students with its fundamental chronology, events, and actors, by exposing them to the new historiography, its questions, and concepts. WR , HU W 1:30pm-3:20pm"

We discuss a range of neuropsychiatric conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, dementia, movement disorders, or traumatic brain injury to understand the challenges presented by these disorders. Whether it’s unraveling the mysteries visual agnosia, attention and memory disorders, or studying the profound shifts in personality after frontal lobe injury, this course provides an exciting journey into the brain’s function from the perspective of individual patients.

Third, language has an enormous amount of hidden structure - words and other linguistic units can have complex relationships with each other that are not apparent on the surface. In this course, we explore the computational approaches that can overcome these challenges.

First, we start with this question of how perception gets us to cognition: How is it that perception transforms raw, unstructured incoming sensory signals arising from our physical environments -- the light that bounces off surfaces and arrives at the retina, raw audio waves hitting the ears, or the vibro-tactile sensations felt at the fingertips when touching a surface -- into things like objects, scenes, events, and agents, into things that we can think about? We draw upon readings and classroom discussions, primarily computational literature, to explore representational and algorithmic hypothesis about seeing and thinking in the mind. Second, we observe that these cognitive hypotheses about mental representations are typically developed in rather sterile, or as scientists we like to call it \"controlled\", settings. We proceed to ask how these cognitive hypotheses about mental representations can be scaled to the messiness and complexity of the real world. This leads us to issues at the intersection of AI, psychology, and cognitive science. Finally, we observe that in most cases, cognitive representations about mental representations don't plausibly or at least readily map onto a brain implementation. So, we ask: How is it that through the distributed and dynamic activity in our brain’s neural circuits, we come to think thoughts about objects and agents, mentally simulate what will happen next, and plan actions accordingly? We explore multi-level theories of intelligence, that make bridges across AI, neuroscience and cognitive science. SO W 9:25am-11:15am"

Topics include the depiction of human mortality and divine immortality in literature, dying as a social process, the development of the notion of an afterlife and the concept of the ‘soul’, and communication with the dead, how these texts have been received in the West, and how they have shaped inherited ideas of the immortality of the soul, human suffering, and divine justice.

    "Course Descrpition": "This course aims to provide students with an alternative reading of the Islamic legal tradition. It upends the view that Islamic law was in some way allergic to change. Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence ( fiqh ), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God’s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions ( fatwā s) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course challenges students to ask what is change within a tradition? In the debates and polemics of legal scholars, we contemplate the appeal and the limitations of reform within Islamic law, tracing how both have been contested and have evolved across different geographies and periods in the Muslim World. Likewise, we rethink the boundaries of continuity. We question how a legal school and a legal canon are constructed and revised, examining the ways in which both are capable of reinforcing – or imperiling – the Islamic legal tradition. Last, we explore the endurance of Islamic law in contemporary Muslim societies. The course reflects on the processes and the consequences of various projects of “modernizing” the Sharīʿa, asking how the institutions of the colonial and postcolonial state have reconfigured Islamic law in radically different ways.

    "Course Descrpition": "Francis of Assisi is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in European history. As one of Catholicism’s most revered saints (often considered to be the greatest male saint ever), his radical message of voluntary poverty, humility and fraternity significantly revived the Catholic church in a moment of profound crisis, and has since been accepted as one of the foundational elements of European thought, receiving universal admiration from diverse thinkers who are often unaffiliated with the Catholic tradition. This course seeks to take both challenges head on. Its pedagogical intent is three-fold. First, by offering a comprehensive overview of the layered accumulation of narratives that has given us the Francis figure so beloved today, it encourages students to examine the ambiguous boundaries of “reliability” with regard to historical narratives, especially those with a mythopoetic flavor. Other than the well-known “Little Flowers”, students are also exposed to less-known “lives” of the saint and are expected to critically compare these sources. Second, students are invited to Socratically wrestle with Francis’ spiritual legacy in light of its obvious conflict with prevalent notions of the “good life” in contemporary America. Third, students will gain a robust understanding of the Franciscan tradition which has left its footprint in vast regions outside of Europe (Jerusalem, East Asia, the Americas), has generated an important school of theology, and continues to stoke prominent public debates through controversial modern figures such as Padre Pio. Background readings on medieval religious history will also be provided. Topics will include orthodoxy and heresy, factional conflict within religious orders, missionary activities, mysticism, female religious life, and faith and the visual arts.

Among the questions we consider are the tension between imagined and real societies and how alternative worlds explore the nature of our own being; the impact of technical progress on human race and whether science fiction anticipates scientific innovation and social change; the appeal of the fantastic to a contemporary reader and how science fiction meets the human need for a desired past or future.

We spend the first part of the course considering the theoretical origins of the doppelgänger in gothic literature, turning to concepts of “the self and other” from psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial theory to help us think broadly through the category. In the second part of the course, we read works of literature that feature encounters with a large cast of doppelgänger sub-types, including alter-egos, shadows, ghosts, and evil twins. Finally, we revisit the doppelgänger trope in the digital age to interrogate how advanced technologies have altered the possibilities for “doubling” through innovations such as AI, cloning, and biogenetic de-extinction projects.

Overarching topics, grounded in medical case studies, include what it means for computers to “think” and how we understand what they are thinking about; the use and limits of scientific knowledge in making policy decisions; bias, fairness, equity, equality; the challenges of implementation of AI systems; safety and risk; and the human/computer interface. The course also provides a high level overview of machine learning, discussing opportunities, limitations, and tradeoffs. Ultimately, the course offers a grounded look at how AI is being discussed and deployed on the ground in medicine, equipping students with a critical lens for thinking about responsible and practical implementation and innovation when it comes to AI.

Beyond questions of scarcity and sustainability, water allows human life to flourish, and without water, there would be no civilization. Yet water is not equitably distributed across time or space, leading to contestation and conflict around water. Against such a background of strife, this course examines how human beings have related to water, to other life forms, and to each other through the control of water, in different historical moments and different parts of the world. The seminar is organized around four porous thematic clusters: (i) “urban water”, to do with cities and urban industrial life; (ii) “agrarian water”, to do with rivers, irrigation systems, and agrarian life; (iii) “rural water”, to do with coasts, lakes, dams and rural life; and (iv) and “living water”, to do with social, cultural and political values, and human and more-than-human life.

    "Course Descrpition": "The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources (including goods, knowledge, information, technologies, etc.). Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that constrain the access of excluded persons to resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts that may include treatises, maps, travel literature, visual culture, material culture (e.g., currency), law, music, and performance art, students investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. More broadly, we explore, describe, and trace the entanglements of bordering, globalizations, and knowledge production in Hispanophone cultures. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are (social) borders and what are the processes through which they persist? How do the effects of practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? What can we learn from indigenous peoples’ responses to bordering process and globalization?  Prerequisite: SPAN 140 or 145, or in accordance with placement results.

    "Course Descrpition": "Critical to colonial, imperial, and capitalist expansion, the Atlantic offers a dynamic setting for adapting ethnographic practices to address questions around interconnected oppressions, revolts, and revolutions that are foundational to global modernity. Anchored in a Spanish and a Colombian port city, this course engages trans-Atlantic 'worlding' through a multi-sited and historically grounded ethnographic lens. Las Palmas—the earliest mid-Atlantic port and Europe's first settler colony in Africa—and Cartagena—once the principal gateway connecting Spain and its American empire—illuminate urgent contemporary issues such as climate, displacement, inter-regional subjectivities, and commerce. During a spring recess field experience (March 8–16, 2026), students immerse themselves for four nights each in Las Palmas and Cartagena, developing critical \"tracking\" skills that bridge ethnographic practice with cultural theory. Preparation for fieldwork includes an on-campus curriculum, organized around Cartagena and Las Palmas, and sessions with Yale Ethnography Hub faculty, covering different methodologies. As part of this broader programming, the curriculum delves into trans-Atlantic migrations from the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa that have transformed port cities, labor and aesthetic practices, class-making racial formations, and global geopolitics.

Attention also paid to the transnational nature of American architecture—the role of colonialism, the global exchange of architectural ideas, and the international careers of some architects.

The program, in The Kitchen’s words, “sought to feature voices that had often been marginalized within many discussions of AIDS, in particular people of color and women.”This course builds upon and is inspired by this aspect of Atlas's visionary presentation, an aspect that used the show to produce a critically multicultural platform that could activate cultural histories and critical traditions from various communities. In effect, the course uses this aspect as a metonym for the racial, gender, sexual, and class heterogeneity of queer art and organizing. It conducts its investigation by looking at a variety of primary materials that illustrate the heterogeneous makeup of queer and trans politics. The course also draws on more recent texts and visual works that arose from the earlier contexts that the primary texts helped to illuminate and shape. HU RP 0 Course cr TTh 11:35am-12:50pm"

Is justice a matter of redistribution, recognition, resources, capabilities, or something more hedonic? Where is power located, or where does it circulate?

We investigate this structure of intimacy through theoretical, historical, ethnographic, literary, and visual materials and think about the various meanings of monogamy historically as well as transnationally. Monogamy is entangled with relations of private property, with colonial civilizational narratives, with scientific theories about human nature. Polygamy in return has historically been understood as religious and/or cultural difference, and as a remnant of pre-modernity. The course weaves together theoretical readings that equip students with the tools to understand some key concepts that we need for our discussion, such as private property; the private family; colonialism and (cultural) imperialism; law and liberalism; and bourgeois morality with readings that more directly address some of the key ways in which monogamy is imagined, understood and framed. We discuss the turn to a recent rise in nonmonogamy in the “West” as a radical and “liberated” alternative to life-long or serial monogamy, at times featuring a critique of the private family, which constitutes a curious contrast to the nonmonogamy of religious and cultural Others of the West. Understanding the contemporary discourses and industries (books, podcasts, therapists’ youtube channels) around polyamory and nonmonogamy as a 21st century strategic unity, we analyze how liberalism has framed our understanding of sexual liberation and discuss alternative approaches to freedom.

Our point of departure is the idea that gender constitutes a “useful category of historical analysis” (Joan Scott). In this course we ask how deviant gender expression can be a category of historical analysis. How do we write history from the perspective of gender fluidity, non-binarism, and gender transgression? How can this history give us the tools to critique regnant norms of gender expression, then and now? How does this historical approach relate to trans* and non-binary people & movements today? The course is historically wide-ranging, from Antiquity to the Early Modern period, and geographically diverse, including Europe, the Middle East, and the colonial Americas. The breath of contexts enable us to consider broad patterns, continuities, and discontinuities.

We examine manifestations of romantic love in medieval Arab cultures as precedents to the invention of courtly love. In the second part of our course, we turn to modern humanistic theories about romantic love. Among the questions that critical theorists and philosophers have posed, we consider: How is love related to desire? Is sexual desire an indispensable component of romantic love? Is romantic love ultimately a selfish, exclusionary act, or is it about renouncing the self, losing the self in the other? In the third part of our course, we apply the insights of parts 1 and 2 to discuss case studies of romantic love in the contemporary United States.

    "Course Descrpition": "This seminar explores the complex interplay between gender, sexuality, and citizenship in the Middle East and North Africa. We examine how they are both shaped by and shape experiences of nationality, migration, and statelessness. Highlighting how gender and sexual minorities, and the gendered regulation of life, more broadly, both animate and contest colonial legacies tied to a racialized notion of “modernity.” Through ethnography, history, and literature, students confront a political economy of intimacies that continuously reshape what it means to be or not to be a citizen. Our approach extends beyond borders and laws to include the everyday acts of citizenship that rework race, religion, and ethnicity across transnational fronts. We discuss how people navigate their lives in the everyday, from the ordinary poetry of identity and belonging to the spectacular drama of war and conflict. Our goal is to challenge orientalist legacies that dismiss theoretical insights from scholarship on and from this region by labeling it as focused on exceptional cases instead of addressing “universal” issues. Instead, we take seriously that the specific historical and social contexts of the Middle East and North Africa reveal how connections based on gender and sexuality within and across families and social classes are deeply entwined with racial narratives of state authority and political sovereignty on a global scale.

    "Course Descrpition": "Why are there so many studies involving trans brain scans? Can facial recognition technology really tell if you’re queer? Why is everyone so obsessed with gay penguins? For that matter, how did science come to be the right tool for defining and knowing sex, gender, and sexuality at all? How does that history influence our collective lives in the present, and what are some alternatives? This course gives students a background in the development of sex science, from evolutionary arguments that racialized sexual dimorphism to the contemporary technologies that claim to be able to get at bodily truths that are supposedly more real than identity. It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer.

    "Course Descrpition": "Questions of subjectivity stand at the base of much feminist, black, queer scholarship yet how subjectivity is constituted, whether it is fixed or fluid, how it links to narratives of experience, and how it can be apprehended in critical inquiry is often left implicit. Beginning with a brief consideration of psychoanalytic conceptions of ‘the subject’, ‘subjectivity’ and their relation to social formations, this course examines some of the ways in which subjectivity has been theorized and brought under critical scrutiny by black diasporic, feminist and queer scholars. It draws on work produced in reference to multiple sites, including the UK, the USA and the Caribbean within the fields of psychoanalysis, social science, the humanities and critical art practice. It aims to critique the divide between ‘interior’ psychic life and ‘exterior’ social selves, as well as considering the relation between ‘freedom’ and subjectivity, including the extent to which ‘freedom’ might require rejection of ‘subjectivity’ as a mode of personhood.

    "Course Descrpition": "Critical to colonial, imperial, and capitalist expansion, the Atlantic offers a dynamic setting for adapting ethnographic practices to address questions around interconnected oppressions, revolts, and revolutions that are foundational to global modernity. Anchored in a Spanish and a Colombian port city, this course engages trans-Atlantic 'worlding' through a multi-sited and historically grounded ethnographic lens. Las Palmas—the earliest mid-Atlantic port and Europe's first settler colony in Africa—and Cartagena—once the principal gateway connecting Spain and its American empire—illuminate urgent contemporary issues such as climate, displacement, inter-regional subjectivities, and commerce. During a spring recess field experience (March 8–16, 2026), students immerse themselves for four nights each in Las Palmas and Cartagena, developing critical \"tracking\" skills that bridge ethnographic practice with cultural theory. Preparation for fieldwork includes an on-campus curriculum, organized around Cartagena and Las Palmas, and sessions with Yale Ethnography Hub faculty, covering different methodologies. As part of this broader programming, the curriculum delves into trans-Atlantic migrations from the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa that have transformed port cities, labor and aesthetic practices, class-making racial formations, and global geopolitics. After recess, the course shifts toward independent work, as students synthesize field-collected data and insights into a collaborative multimodal group project and individual ethnographic papers.  Interested students must apply by November 1st via the course website. Students may withdraw by the university deadlines in April. Prerequisite: Conversational and reading proficiency in Spanish. Readings are in English and Spanish, with assignments accepted in either language. HU Th 1:30pm-3:20pm"
