    "curriculum": "History Track:\nUMass Boston's Master of Arts in History offers a rigorous set of individually selected courses and supervised research and writing. Both demanding and flexible, the history track is designed for students who intend to pursue a PhD, secondary school teachers who wish to improve their knowledge of the field, and students who seek to test their capacity for graduate work. The program is designed to accommodate teachers with a demanding schedule but who wish to pursue their MA part time.\nThose who desire to pursue advanced study for their own intellectual enjoyment and development can also benefit from the program's design, and the department welcomes prospective students who have been out of school for a long time or who have majored in other areas of study and now wish to pursue the study of history.\nAll graduate courses consist of small seminars of no more than fifteen students, which affords all students close faculty attention and support. Not all students enter the graduate programs in history directly from college: the student body includes individuals who beginning graduate work after long absences from school. Applicants do not need to have majored in history as undergraduates, but they may be asked to pursue a program of coursework designed to remedy deficiencies in their preparation for graduate study.\nKnowledge of a foreign language is not required for the Master of Arts in History. Thesis advisors may require a foreign language if they determine that competence in a particular language is necessary for students to conduct research on the topic on which a student will write his or her thesis. In that case, students must demonstrate competence in the foreign language to the satisfaction of their advisors.\nFor those writing a Thesis:\nHIST 600: Research and Methods\nHIST 605: Introduction to Historiography\nHIST 690: Final Project Prep (Students should have at least 18 credits before taking FPP)\nHIST 699: Thesis\nFive electives, two of which can be upper-level undergraduate courses (300 level or higher)\nFor those writing a History Review Essay:\nHIST 600: Research and Methods\nHIST 605: Introduction to Historiography\nHIST 690: Final Project Prep (Students should have at least 18 credits before taking FPP)\nHIST 693: History Review Essay\nSix electives, two of which can be upper-level undergraduate courses (300 level or higher)\nThesis\nThe thesis stands as the traditional culmination of a student's graduate work, and students who wish to pursue a PhD should plan to write a thesis. The thesis should be approximately 50-70 pages long and based on original research. It should be the equivalent to an article in a scholarly journal. Theses are written under the guidance of an individual faculty advisor and defended before a committee of three faculty members, one of whom may be from outside the department. For more information on thesis requirements, see the Graduate Program Handbook.\nHistory Review Essay\nThe History Review Essay is an alternative to the thesis. This option is only for students in the History Track. These essays are 25-30 page reviews of existing literature that demonstrate wide, deep reading in and extensive knowledge of the student's chosen field. They are equivalent to the 'state of the field' essays that appear regularly in scholarly journals. Essays showcase the student's ability to synthesize, analyze, and evaluate secondary texts by asking critical questions about historiography, research methods, sources, and theory. History Review Essays are as challenging as theses, but highlight different skills. They are especially appropriate for those who do not plan future academic publications, for teachers looking to synthesize a broad range of scholarship, and for those who do not have ready access to primary source repositories.\nFor more information on curriculum, including course descriptions and degree requirements, visit the\nAcademic Catalog\n."
