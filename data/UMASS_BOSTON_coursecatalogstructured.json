The course will cover the emerging concepts of biological individuality (self and the microbiome) and models of immune development and response. Intended to complement, but not to replace, a course in human immunology, students will learn about trade-offs with immune function, and how immunological responses of individuals scale up to the population and ecosystem levels by exerting influence on pathogen transmission. In particular, comparative sickness behaviors, social distancing, and pathogen avoidance behaviors will be one focal topic.

But we will spend just as much time trying to understand what it was like for typical Romans to live through this period. We will study armies and taxes, but also the rise of Christianity, the prevalence of slavery, the shifting gender norms, and the stories that filled the imaginations of people throughout this time. We will discuss major ancient cities like Rome and Constantinople, but we'll also venture out to the edges of the Empire and beyond learning about the Goths, Celts, Sassanians, and more.In addition to learning about the transformation of the Roman Empire between 250 and 800, students will also practice thinking like historians; that is, we will think about possibilities and limitations of the wide range of sources that historians use to piece together what happened and why it matters.

The dance form involves \"a complex array of interlocking rhythms, percussive accents of isolated body parts popping out in unexpected phrasing,\" (Andre Lepecki, ed., Of the Presence of the Body, 2004). Key figures in its early development in the 1970's are Afrika Baambata, a rapper who is credited with forming the first group of hip hop dancers, and DJ Kool Herc of Jamaican origin who brought his two turntables to the block parties in the South Bronx. Its influences range from African dance and Brazilian Capoeira to James Brown, Michael Jackson and, more recently, music videos. This course covers the variety of components that make up Hip Hop Dance: poppin', lockin', wavin', steppin', top rockin', and downrockin' and basic breakin'. The course material will help students develop strength, coordination and a strong mental focus while they thoroughly enjoy moving themselves to the lively rhythms of hip hop music. This is a practical course in which the great majority of time will be spent practicing dance technique and choreography. While we may occasionally view a video, most of our time will be spent actually dancing. We will become familiar with basic Hip Hop moves and practice putting these moves into combination in challenging ways. We will further enhance our knowledge of Hip Hop through the writing of two papers. Material learned in class will prepare us for an end-of-semester studio performance.",

Students will gain a foundational understanding of how to move from \"I would like to operate an aquaculture business\" to \"I am operating an aquaculture business\". Building on this understanding, students will prepare their own business plans to demonstrate mastery of key aspects of operational efficiency necessary support the vital financial structure of any business. Lastly, through the concepts of entrepreneurship, students will learn how to integrate business concepts to be able to develop and sustain a successful aquaculture business.

The course considers the conditions of work and life for immigrants themselves - including differences in conditions for different immigrant groups- as well as effects on people in the countries from which immigrants come. It looks at immigration restrictions not only in terms of their effects on the number of people entering the United States, but also in terms of their effects on the status and rights of people who live and work here. The course also looks seriously at the relationship between the conditions under which immigration takes place, on the one hand, and wages and conditions of work, on the other. It pays particular attention to the effects of immigration law and enforcement on immigrant workers' bargaining power at work.",

The topics we will cover include measurements and data of inequality; inequality in different aspects; causes of inequality; public opinions towards inequality; and the implications of rising inequality for democracy, autocracy and governance with a focus on redistributive policies. We will also touch on questions of why inequality should be studied in the first place - that is, why should anyone care about the growing gap between the rich and the poor; and what is the ideal level of inequality?",

While psychology historically has focused on experimental and quasiexperimental approaches to learning, increasingly psychologists are viewing these as only one approach to learning and embracing a wider variety approaches to building knowledge about people's lives and the societies within which they live. The course is designed to introduce students to some of these alternate ways of conducting research that are based on analyzing interviews and text. These methods are especially helpful in studying human experiences and actions (e.g., emotion, dialogue, psychotherapy), and in studying experiences of minorities and marginalized people. The course culminates in students' development of their own research proposals. The following are the course objectives: (1) To understand some of the historical and philosophical foundations for qualitative methods; (2) to become acquainted with a range of qualitative methods that are used in psychology; (3) to learn how to collect and analyze data; (4) to learn how to write a research proposal using APA format and understand how results are presented; and (5) to learn to evaluate qualitative research studies. They help to develop the skills of how to ask questions and seek out information that will guide you - skills that can transfer into many settings. Students have used their proposals as the basis for an honors thesis, as a proposal for research in their workplace, to apply for grants, and as writing samples for graduate studies. It is especially helpful for students who wish to complete a thesis or apply to graduate programs in the social sciences. These skills build from one class to the next so students need to commit to attending this class regularly.",

But we will spend just as much time trying to understand what it was like for typical Romans to live through this period. We will study armies and taxes, but also the rise of Christianity, the prevalence of slavery, the shifting gender norms, and the stories that filled the imaginations of people throughout this time. We will discuss major ancient cities like Rome and Constantinople, but we'll also venture out to the edges of the Empire and beyond learning about the Goths, Celts, Sassanians, and more.In addition to learning about the transformation of the Roman Empire between 250 and 800, students will also practice thinking like historians; that is, we will think about possibilities and limitations of the wide range of sources that historians use to piece together what happened and why it matters. How do we know what we know about the past? And why should we care how history is written?",

Going beyond seated mediation, we will explore contemplative practices and the traditional creative arts (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. poetry and calligraphy); musical meditations; and contemplative body-mind practices (e.g. walking meditation, yoga, and/or Qi Gong).

Those students seeking to go on to a PhD program will be advised to pursue a research-based capstone project. In addition, the Capstone Seminar provides participants with an opportunity to review and reflect on their work in the TCCS Master's program and its impact on their current and future professional and personal lives. In sharing their process and products with each other throughout the semester, students will be able to demonstrate knowledge and integration of skills, process, and strategies of transdisciplinary thinking and grounded, local/global, reflective practice. Capstone projects will be presented by and for seminar participants, together with public audiences, as appropriate, during the final third of the semester.",

Practitioners also play roles in organizations outside of schools-in community groups, sports teams, religious groups, etc. The course helps look at those organizations and the roles played within them, by offering a broad set of perspectives drawn from the extensive literature on organizations. Learning to understand and use multiple perspectives for analyzing organizations allows us to reflect on our roles in them, even as it expands the set of possible choices for taking action and leadership within them.",

Without translation, a critical activity that connects otherwise separate languages and cultures, readers and writers would be left in relative isolation, unaware of wider trends in world literature.
